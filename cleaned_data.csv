whoa cant believe its expensive travel out of dumaguete im sure because of lack of competition why did choose dumaguete over cebu travel bohol cebu has tons of options several departures daily more than by slow fast ferry combined from bohol rate twice cheaper cebu best way base yourself if plan travel outlying islands other destinations all of philippines because options are aplenty with several departures daily fast ferry slow ferry pump boat banca cruisetype ship or by air rates are even cheaper because of competitions,en,,

price like scam,hr,,
days work middle class filipinos but its more or less week or more of work working class its why people prefer use unsafe transportation regardless its an archipelago middle of two oceans beset by typhoons at least six times year interisland transport always will be difficult most filipinos rarely leave islands they are based much less afford trips like el nido etc which one of reasons why we like watching these videos shows us parts of country we have never been likely never willalso may sound counterintuitive but larger boat lower price comes boats larger than typical filipino outriggers also depends on how many passengers take route regularly fast catamarans are relatively cheaper because they travel routes which have tons of passengers its similar tricycle vs jeepney situation tricycles are more expensive same distance,en,,
very nice place,cs,,

dont see anything wrong with your comments man theyre constructive destructive disrespectful comments on your show usually come from people who do not genuinely know how cook or appreciate food these are people who only show up by time food already served or are probably fast food junkies not worth your attention sir are one of culinary specialists who have embraced filipino food culture genuinely unpretentious enough tell us bad side of filipino culinary arts thank your haters are type of people who do not even know how boil water or would overfry an egg or hotdog never mind them just keep on making your constructive comments good filipinos are all ears,en,,

what hate about getting degree philippines having prc license worked hard does not make any difference just end up getting minimum wage same as other people best degree get country would be business industry our country best business but never employees healthcare degrees worst dont get me wrong its nice help out other people but not at expense use years of your life quotoverworked yet underpaidquot this what our country consider as some sort of altruism or something other people looked up too this also very reason why nobody changes system lot of people complain how high medical bills are but most employee who works at private hospitals only gets bit of salary kind of hate reality of hospital business owners they would get lot of patients be served but would only hire few staffs do work get work hours day with working lunch around x week salary would probably pay bills but then are we just born pay those bills isnt ironic how most medical professionals are also same people who doesnt have time exercise or eat right not because they dont want but simply because they dont actually have time them how do even spend time with your family with those kind of hours or do some household chores this very reason why all our medical professional go other countries just not really worth stay unless someone gets brave enough change kind of healthcare system we have as long as your employer philippines wouldnt get salary can enjoy your life have whole of friends working on bpos even before they had their degrees they have far by better salary even just working from their homes than getting too overworked underpaid working hospitals,en,,

while agree with some of your points its not very good not go college there are some flaws your argumentfirst of all think most of would agree college degrees are almost necessity companies first look at candidates resume see if they have college degrees if look at job postings can see almost all postings require degree while its true dont necessarily need degree acquire skill set want most companies look people who attained higher education than high school its better have degree than none at allsecond point your examples people who succeeded without college degrees are not majority most who didnt have degree are struggling find jobs or even set up business reasons financial illiteracy lack of capital etc even bill gates himself college dropout suggested others not be like him especially todays economy college degrees are necessity httpswwwnytimescomupshotbillgatescollegedropoutdontbelikemehtml,en,,

good points there do agree anybody can have high paying job even if one didnt go college however lets also consider education philippines far different from us or other countries especially high school believe us high school students are given vocational lessons such as how fix cars heck even driving lessons are taught school inother countries whereas here philippines at least back then its all books about general science or history know no real application comes everyday life except english guess guess my point filipinos graduate high school before k program they were not given skill sets yet college was one of solutions also why agree with k program because vocations certain skillsets are incorporated senior high school if this educational system continues philippines then yeah would totally agree with your point as speaker myself whenever have talk front of students always encourage them attend seminars or skills training while theyre young always improve on their hobbies or skills their grasp of english language would always recommend downloading free elearning apps duolingoanyway ive said too much already great video more videos come please,en,,

do get your point but not everyone as lucky as some are some may not need go college yet ended up successfully because they have skill fate on favor but some they are still finding skillset are saying maybe college plus depends on person because lot philippines wants go college because they want have degree something say society their familyso how can say such we dont need go college just do some online research am not being mean just saying,en,,
how can we get good jobs,so,,
yes strongly agree with mr david but guess really depends on determination of person how they are eager learn more about their passion or hobby we can become successful whether we have college degree or not one way by applying simple jobs which doesnt require any degrees from there were going learn anythingeg skills including products of business also its concepts later if were ready createbuild business were just going improve productwhatever product or concept business had make more unique our own businessthis what ive realized years ago everything this world very useful us how if know how put an importance something know how make something could be of great use everybody this only requires creativity ive realized this because im disabled person most of us will be treated differently by most of normal people thats also realized sometimes people who are different can also make big differences through his own talent or skill if only we know how make ourselves important anyone or any business how make everybody important us another thing if youre creator of something then have power improve more because of things have learned while building something what also realized if did go school years ago my learning would only be limited what your course or school wants learn means can only focus one specific jobgreat video mr davidthanks thisharold here from cebu,en,,

hey david make some good points skills matter more however would not say why filipinos should not go college but perhaps why filipinos should not necessarily go college just like said certain professions would require have both degree skills was born raised got my first degree from philippines my second degree from uk became teacher know what also landed me job us without degree no school would entrust me teach their students of course like said also needed skill also had go us college acquire more skills get certified or will have switch careers currently teach at public school atlanta area because of my college degrees other professions yes may not be same case likewise being successful doesnt necessarily translate earning big bucks true very important aspect of anyones financial goal but some people fulfillment of being their profession of choice more of priority thus even if those high paying jobs dont require college degree but require specialty skills may sound like better option other people may consider certain careers of their choice do require college degree more of priority whether or not they do get paid lot using my profession again as an example we dont get paid as much as many other professionals like doctors or laywers but more of callingso my opinion not much about whether or not need college degree but more on what your calling if what want do life doesnt really require college degree then focus on building specialized skills will be successful if are academic type who wants get career on certain fields then by all means get college degree,en,,

hi david am sorry dont totally agree nor disagree with your topics college education skills are all acquired practiced thru time be proficient there are many unemployed college vocational grads philippines because of lack of opportunities acquire skills meaning no vacancies be filled such jobs college or vocational course grad has theories disciplines of particular curriculum taken but still greenhorn comes practicing hone skills one must not stop seeking opportunities being said doesnt necessarily follows us pilipinos should not go college its ridiculous illogical illadvise just because few uneducated persons became successful just because some college grads cant find jobs then your advise not go college anymore thats sorry say this very moronic point of view pilipinos try pursue finish college not only because of degree title but also salaries commensurate parents will even break their backs just see their children finish college just compare salary of an engineer of skilled carpenter can see logical reason why pilipinos want go college higher salaries means way of uplifting or upgrading ones status life agree with skills are very important but not only salaried jobs but also everyday lives like house chores driving vehicles name few even more on being selfemployed but please dont discourage pilipinos pursue college coz like music education part parcel of pilipino culture all philippine government has do open up lure local andor foreign investors create jobs education not an obsolete thing its lifetime commitment both college degrees technical skills of pilipinos made them excel envied by some countries especially our ofws they can be at par if not even surpass western peoples if one cannot pursue finish college one reason or other then deviate other possibilities could make one skillful be productive instead of discouraging them not go college if then tell government let all colleges universities be closed forever if think its best solution which think more than absurd meaningless pointless mga kabayan hindi ko gusto ang inuugali nitong dayuhan na ito sa kanyang mga sinasabi eh naka ilang panahon lang siya dito sa atin eh akala mo siya na ang pinaka magaling magpayo tungkol sa buhay natin noong una hinangaan ko siya sa pagkanta ng mga awitin natin pero ngaun kung pinapayuhan nya tayong mga pinoy na huwag nang magaral o magtapos ng kolehiyo na parang bagang siya ay isang dalubhasa sa ekonomiya natin eh gayung isa rin yta siyang hindi nkapagtapos eh para bagang binababoy at minamaliit niya tau at iyan ay hindi ko gusto maaaring may kaunti siyang punto ngunit hindi nangangahulugan tama na ang lahat ng sinabi nya masama loob ko kapag tinatapakan ang ating bansat mga kababayan eh dayuhan man siya o hindi mahal ko ang bansa natin ano man ang kakulangan nito wala nman perpektong bayan o gobyerno eh,en,,

honestly best solution would probably be have mass gram of something like implanted implants or are days become of age have period at point your life youre ready have child can financially care child already implants can simply be removed im also favor of system us believe or not nothing else going work its just not way children are teenagers can finish school have future dont end up with children of their own living deep pottery these families are poor they cant provide medical care these children just watched another video where baby died after suffering at home days because family had money treat him dont understand why these parents dont take responsibility themselves even if they are on educated they should know they should not have children unless they before them myself make probably times but these people dead even with still have decided not have child because know do not make enough money myself give child what feel would be proper life have home food air conditioning running water heat water tanks everything have all basic necessities but even with free schooling still dont feel can make enough properly care child,en,,
