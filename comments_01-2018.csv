This is legit best Vlog everything is smooth. The cuts are smooth they aren&#39;t at surprise and intro is rlly smooth and the intro is smooth and originally made which is even better
I mean like srsly this is better than other vlogs that have million views
"U have pretty sick edits, how the hell do u even have 520 subs, u deserve more"
Aww yes &lt;3
"Try searching for Sumaguing Cave in Sagada. Im not the caving type of person (i was fooled by my friend that it was just a short trip, like walk in the park) but i loved it when reached the intagrammable area."
OMG....WOWWWWW!!!!! I wanna go there!!! when were you there? almost no tourist... that&#39;s good right?  small place few people. not like boracay &amp; similar places (except palawan i guess). how much did it cost you?  this vid is so amazing &amp; so amusing guys. so much enjoyed. had me smile &amp; laugh the whole vid time part 1 &amp; 2. trina is so baywatch sexy. is trina from thai or filipino family? i wanna meet a blonde version of trina and go around exploring also. please help me find one.
Hahaha! That was crazy! I laughed hard when u didn&#39;t know what to say after the exp for a second there. I know it was a bit scary. Good thing ur guide stayed confident all throughout.
"If I may say, Trina look so beautiful coming out from the caving!"
And because of this I&#39;m subscribing!!! The sfx made the adventure even more intense! You did fantastic!
Survivor Philippines: Trina &amp; Pierre Edition üòÖ
"Amazing! This spelunking should require a proper equipment but you guys did it! Just like how we, locals do. Thumbs up to Trina! Man, she just slew the rocks off!"
<b>iSLAND HOPPiNG</b> iS THE BEST!¬†üáµüá≠
OMG! U guys are amazingly crazy for doing such adventures.  üñí‚ù§üëè
I love it when you compliment your wife. This vlog is full of love. üòçüòçüòç
"Haha, congrats on making it through that. That looked intense. I grew up in that province and I&quot;m surprised they didn&#39;t tell you that there ¬†are snakes and rats in the water when it floods. You guys did great! It must have been a great experience."
"Haha, nice jungle adventure. Seems like you went on a setting of an &quot;escape from a deserted island&quot; movie. üòÅ"
Now that was fun. Awesome video.
You got an amazing girl. You&#39;re correct you every guys should look for that kind of girl. Best of luck to you both. Take care to your trips.
Go to Sambawan and Maripipi Islands in Biliran... You will be blown away...
"That&#39;s Bakwitan Cave and I also did your trek  last November 2017... But, I was only up until the main entrance coz it felt kinda spooky hehehe Kudos to you guys for finishing the journey... I  only wanted Instagram worthy photos hahaha Islas de Gigantes is amazing! I had a great and memorable time... btw, I also stayed at Gigantes Hideaway..."
"I have been enjoying your videos for days now and you have to be two of the most entertaining travel vloggers on YouTube! Also, not gonna lie, my halflife-geek self was tickled when you compared the roots hanging in the cave to the ones in the game. :D<br>Enjoy Philippines!"
Go to Banaue Rice Terraces
Awesome caving experiemce.  Visit Batanes group of Island i highly recommend it.
I have a suggestion  can u change ur youtube channel name so that it easy to search   just suggestion not a big deal
i love it awesome video
Good vlogging guys
oh les chaussures d&#39;escalades........
Its great video....
"Trina is such a trooper!  Very impressed with her!  You too, Pierre, you guys put happy in the world of vlogging, Happy 2018!!"
"Try to go to Luzon like in Bagiuo city, Banaue rice terraces, Sagada, Vigan and Hundred Islands"
"I suggest going to the &quot;HEAVEN ON EARTH OF THE PHILIPPINES&quot;. You will have to enter a barn then climb up a lot of stairs, enter a dark &quot;cave&quot; and on the other end, you will end up in a COMPLETELY white open space place on the top of the mountain. When you look down, you will feel like you&#39;re in a cloud. I suggest wearing sunglasses and white clothes. Not only because it will make you look like angels, but also because the heat will fry you. Everything there is too bright and you will feel overwhelmed seeing the place. Don&#39;t worry, they have fresh cow milk ice cream waiting back at the bottom of the mountain of stairs. You&#39;ll get what I mean when/ if you get there. The place is called the GarinFarm of San Joaquin. Look it up! You adventurers will love it! I&#39;ve been there last 2017! Enjoy and bless your trips! üòÑüòâüòäüòòüòúüòáüíï I also entered more less intense caves with crystals and funny rock formations! (That would be in a different place.)"
just discovered your channel. watched yout videos and I am hooked!! definately love the &quot;episode&quot; feels on your vlog. Like you have yo watch everything causr each video gets exciting. :) subscribed and will marathon your other vlogs tonight :)

So nice you experienced alot and very different from other tourist.
Next stop Palawan Coron  and El Nido
Awesome cave experience üëåüèªüëåüèª watched this from the beach in puerto Vallarta
Go to Siquijor. It is really amazing.
I recomend siargao island guys.
That was absolutely breathtaking experience.
Dumaguete! apo island swim with the turtles üòÅ
you guys looks so tired... hehehe
Great adventure guys! Caving is tiring but awesome experience. Missing out our caving in one of the cave in sagada on the north physically tiring but very unforgettable .
"try batanes, malapascua, siargao and bicol region"
"This video stressed me out, you guys are so crazy and adventurous!"
Just when you thought is was just a regular cave tour but ended up so extreme hehe.. once of the best gigantes adventure so far.
Maybe you ought to add..how not to dress for caving...lol!
no more PH vlogs?üòî
You guys look tired.  Probably the caving was a bit stressful.
Great video! Thank you for loving Philippines.
":D glad to see you enjoyed the caving experience.  Wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that without proper clothing  and gear. Also, not too man crocs left in populated areas, but keep a watch out for hitch hiking leeches and the occasional snake :D"
"Hi guys.... that was an intense caving..... try go up north of the Philippines in a place called Banawe and Sagada, you&#39;ll find amazing mountains there and the beautiful rice terraces."
All you needed was a crowbar. LOL
that was a unique experience. I will do it myself. Your wife is a super woman. She has no trouble navigating the cave.
Hi guys! Take care of yourself always. God bless !
nice cave and amazing view outside take care guys!

may all time favorite Sisig..
tocino is bacon ü•ì in spanish so is it mexican burrito mixed with filipino ?
Still waiting to run into you guys at Seafood city! Lol
Guys you should cook sisig on your next video.
We need a place like that here in the Phils
I want a sisig taco too!! üò©üò©üò©
That burrito could feed five people.  :D
"Philippine street food includes dirty ice cream (sorbetes) with cones. But you know filipinos wont be satisfied with cones so most wanted bread. So it becomes a staple, bread or cone."
"I miss eating ube ice cream i a bun(pandesal)! We used to do it when we were kids. Dang, you guys made me hungry and it&#39;s almost midnight."
yummmmmmmmyyy. How bout trying  BEEF OR CHICKEN SHAWARMA!!!!

I love that Kayla&#39;s learning to do the man bite.
Another great selection from Big Boys! I would love to try them if ever they will have a branch here in Manila.
"Food review, mukbang the best! Ive always wanted you guys to do this..."
That&#39;s how we eat icecream in the philippines. The icecream man usually has buns and cones with him and people usually goes for the bun.
Finally the sisig!!! Now i want to try that version of sisig!! I wonder what it really taste like!!.<br><br>PS: Gabe always go for the big bites! Hahaha no hold backs
I&#39;m gonna try sisig taco!!!!
Sisg taco and tocino burrito üò± there‚Äôs no way that doesn‚Äôt taste good!
"It&#39;s time for you to concoct your own halo-halo at home for the kids to try. Buy some bottled preserved halo-halo ingredients, leche flan, ube or cheese or pandan ice cream, and make shaved ice. Oops, I forgot that that it&#39;s still cold there, but plan it out for warmer weather."
Your enthusiasm for food is fantastic! Are you guys planning on visiting the Philippines any time soon?
Omg so delicious üòçüëåüèº

Looks like the underwater life is thriving....unlike that Island you guys first visited in Greece.  Trina&#39;s beauty makes your island photography that much more pleasurable and interesting...Yes!

Philippines has lots of paradise. You can‚Äôt get enough of them. And the people are sooo friendly.

My town close there but I&#39;ve never been in that island.üòÇ
FANTASTIC!
"Try to visit North Luzon especially Cagayan Valley, it is where Palaui Island(2 Seasons of Survivor America taped) is located, they call it the Boracay of the North. There&#39;s a lot of beaches overvthere. And if you love spelunking you can visit Callao Cave. And if you love food, you must try the famous Batil Patong(Pancit) of Tuguegarao City."
WOW! ¬†GREAT ViDEOS!
it looks breathtaking and completely amazing!!!
You two make such fun videos. I love how goofy both of you are. Enjoy your adventure!
Hi cool video love it

"The main island is called Panay, Iloilo is just one of the 3 provinces in that island."
"Go to masbate if you want to see cattle farm in real cowboy/cowgirl in beach to,, masbate is a part of the Philippines it&#39;s a beautiful island"
That&#39;s were  Johnny Depp buried all his booz. XD

Speechless..... WOW üëçüëçüëç
The best video of the island that ive seen so far
<b>I think iloilo is near boracay?</b> ü§ó
"If you are crazy for beaches with great rock formation. Come back to the Philippines and visit Coron, Palawan. Google it and you will know what i am saying. Thanks for coming to our country, both of you are most welcome to come back anytime."
Trina has a bubbly personality üòç
Yes agreed! I love that its still super local and not touristy at all. Definitely one of the best hidden gems in the Philippines! Hideaway resort ftw!
I would like to ask permission to post yout video on my page.
Gigantes means Giant.
"visit calaguas island located at camarines norte ,its either paracale or vinson .."
"they were right, if u live in sea coast u gotta eat tons of those. unlike if ur inland - where there are plenty of vegs."

You may have left my country but I still find your video interesting. Hope you had the best moments of your lives visiting good places in the Philippines.
I love Gigantes! Camping there is the way to go. Hopefully it stays the way it is....devoid of tourists lol. My dad said there was a hotel back in the 70s. Not sure what happened to it though.

"The woman is naturally beautiful and sexy, is she your wife or girlfriend? Glad you enjoy my country Philippines!"
"Wow!  That&#39;s 50 scallops for $1.  Where else can you have scallops for that price?  Nowhere!  Nice job, guys!   Thanks!"
Very nice video.
Lovely couple in a beautiful islands! Wonderful!
Awesome video!
"My family‚Äôs from Estancia, and I used to visit almost every summer.  Gigantes was always a favorite.  Haven‚Äôt been back in long time though, but try checking on the other Islands in the area -  Sicogon, Bayas and Balbagon.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your stay!"
Amazing islands...thanks for sharing.

You should visit guimaras too and watch dinagyang fiestival  of iloilo city this coming January and it&#39;s nice if u can visit Batanes island as well.
"Love the hat Pierre! Here&#39;s a story for your mother about that:<br> <br>My father lived in Taiwan for several years and became fluent in Mandarin. He was so good that native speakers, after hearing him on the phone, were surprised when they found that he was a white person from the US. He visited China when he was in his 60&#39;s and wore a generic baseball cap to cover his bald head. When he was touring a certain site, another tourist from a country which shall remain unnamed started ragging him about the hat and wouldn&#39;t let up. My dad, who was mild-mannered, wasn&#39;t quick with the comebacks and just felt humiliated. I still get mad when I think about someone doing that to my dad. I think that one of the beautiful things about travel that you must be experiencing now is learning the truth of the adage, &quot;Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover.&quot; This other tourist must have pegged my father as just another &quot;ugly American&quot; and nothing could have been further from the truth. Were he alive today, I doubt that he&#39;d be here in the States watching our democracy crumble. He&#39;d probably be doing what you&#39;re doing. So, keep wearing your hat in honor of my dad and to celebrate &quot;viva la difference.‚Äù<br><br>Love the vlogs.... I&#39;m a bit old and decrepit now myself so most of my travel is vicarious and you are making it look like so much fun! Thank you so very much for taking the time to share your journey with us."
"it feels like you own the paradise, because you were the only tourist/blogger on that island, and the local people are happy that you visited the place. In addition, kudos to the amazing videography!"
"Would you have known about these islands if you weren&#39;t stranded because of the typhoon? Isla Gigantes may not be that well known yet, to foreign tourists at least but it&#39;s slowly getting there. Good to know you guys are safe and were able to explore this place before it blows up. Safe travels and enjoy the rest of your stay in the islands."
"Trina looks like a filipina, what is her nationality?"
Beautifully shot video my friend
Such beautiful scenery.
wow awesome island
Wow! You&#39;ve got amazing shots out there. You&#39;re lucky to be firsts of the few foreigners who were able to explore while it is not yet touristy.
Looks like paradise...wow.

"Are you happier now that you‚Äôre back in the states? I‚Äôm sure you are comparing the 2 lives both lived. I have not subscribed to the other ones you have as I live it on a daily basis. I‚Äôm sure you would rather be back there living the life of Riley and having an income to boot. <br>I‚Äôm sure it sounds kinda personal but , wouldn‚Äôt you rather work and live in P.I.? I‚Äôm sure you will be able to find a suitable employer that will do the same. Is your income better now than it was? I would‚Äôve thought you will be in California or Seattle."

Silly me!! Just realised now that you start your vlog each time by saying ‚Äúanthonites ‚Äú I though u said and tonight!! I was wondering for long time why would u say tonight while ur doing it in broad daylight.ugh!!! I‚Äôm so silly üòÇüòÇüò≠nwei love ur vlog and u continue to do it even when u go back homeüëç
"I&#39;m a Filipino here in Montreal Canada üá®üá¶ &amp; really I enjoy your blog in my country because you&#39;re the only one I found roaming around metro Manila &amp; explore.

You and other foreign bloggers became part of our culture &amp; our tourism. That&#39;s why we Philippine bloggers like you, Kulas,Finn... but even you go out of Philippines &amp; still making blog we gonna support you because you&#39;re already part of us as Filipino family. Thank you üòä good luck üòâ &amp; God bless you always!"
LOL! All along I thought you were saying AND TONIGHT...only now i realized that it is ANTHONITES...I&#39;ve been asking myself why is he saying tonight even in the broad daylight :)
"hopefully once your&#39;e back in Alabama you&#39;ll still be vlogging, maybe even travel to another destination you&#39;ve never been to before"

I&#39;m happy u had a wonderful time in the Philippines
"YES!!! This year is going to be all about the could haves and should haves and would haves. Very inspirational, Anthony. You&#39;ve kind of made it seem as though you&#39;re leaving and giving up this paradise. That would be a shame...I just found your channel man. So 10 things(tough?);<br>1. Glad I finally moved out of my apartment in the States, now I only have to pay 1 rent instead of 2.<br>2. Glad I found so many cool vloggers to research and watch and learn from.<br>3. Glad for the peace of mind.<br>4. The stress free Philippines(traffic excluded)<br>5. Glad I found adobo and pancit.<br>6. Glad renting a scooter isn&#39;t a hard thing to do, makes it easier to get out and see the sights.<br>7. Glad for the road trips that #6 has been able to provide.<br>8. Glad to finally be taking care of me without feeling guilty.<br>9. Glad for the new friends I have made.<br>10.... I&#39;m going to leave this one blank as something to work on for next year."
"Watching your vlogs gave me the confidence to do my own and also gave me ideas for content. The last thing you mentioned to me about knowing who my audience is just hit me like a brick wall, that was the most helpful thing you gave and all thanks to watching you Antman!"
Hi bro

"Just a friendly f.y.i, that is not a ferry thats a fastcraft"
"Hey man, I was thinking of taking the same ferry (along with 8 other people) from Dumaguete to Tagbilaran next month.<br>Do you suggest buying the tickets in advance? Or just purchase tickets on the day of travel?<br>Merci!"
elle est bonne ta trina
t un francais pierre ?
I think they are only service between Dumaguete &amp; Tagbiliran<br>= a monopoly and high prices. Between tagbiliran &amp; cebu 3-4 carriers and 2 hour crossing as low as 350 peso open air
Guys How If theres an Iceburg Lmao Hahaha That will be Horible no lifeboats
I am literally having a vlog marathon. Lmao. üíï btw that ferry sucks lmao. but the drone shots tho. üòç
Ha sure? Buti nga yung sa inyo 700 pesos lang kmi nga eh 1000 singil isa sa amin.. bkit gnun?
sis are you mayweather&#39;s sister?
"well, as far as I know , you usually can buy the ticket 2-3 hours before the actual departure..."
LOVE!
agree i can only hope this gets viral so it gets the attention of the government
"Bit expensive for the ferry because dumaguete to bohol is far than cebu to bohol, look at the map."
"The Best way to go travel in the <a href=""http://phil.book/"">Phil.Book</a> your flights very early, in any airlines here that offer Promo flights .we travel manila to Iloilo for 45 min. Cost only 1,<a href=""http://500.00.it/"">500.00.It</a> is 24 hours travel in a ship sea liners."
Ohh  so expensive .
"Are you able to give the name of your resort with the awesome accomodation please,?"
Are you using drones for the aerial shots?
"Oh my ghad! We were on the same ferry! It was on december 23rd right? <br>It&#39;s really expensive, but if you&#39;re a student, you can actually get a discount."
"You are complaining u r paying only 700-1000, thats really nothing compare to other places like NY!! Come on guys!"
I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING! Woah ü§ò We were on the same ferry and I saw you literally vlogging. I was like &quot;OMG there&#39;s a vlogger!&quot; I was hesitant to go to you but I&#39;m so overwhelmed that I saw a vlogger before my eyeeees üòç I&#39;m a fan now!
Coucou c&#39;est guizmo
Tina is so funny! I like her.
Welcome to my hometown po üòçüòò i miz dumaguety <br>One of your subcriber frm taiwan üòò
Okay I‚Äôm 1/3 through the video and I realised you were almost robbed with those prices! It‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs not supposed to be expensive travelling from Duma. This is going to kill tourism long term.
Oh my god that‚Äôs my town. I miss Duma. Thank you for this video!
"That&#39;s true, if you are a local <a href=""http://filipino.it/"">Filipino.it</a> is very expensive to do the way foreigners enjoying the famous tourist spot&#39;s of the Philippines."
That is a great place. We stayed there a couple of years ago and it was clean and comfy and the beach was nice. Their breakfast is also great.
of course you have to pay more because you&#39;re taking a fastcraft. im from bohol and we usually pay 400 pesos for a trip to cebu if we take oceanjet. dumaguete is on another island farther from cebu so it is just reasonable that you pay more. you can always take a roro from dumaguete to cebu and cebu to bohol if you want to pay less.
Its expensive coz its much faster perry.
Approximately $14 ang ticket.... langya pang mcdo lang niya yun sa new york kung saan sya nanggaling nagrereklamo pa...

"la travers√©e √©tait agit√©e... mais quelle r√©compense √† l&#39;arriv√©e, super"
"P700 from Dumaguete to Bohol? That&#39;s insane! Bohol is closer to Dumaguete than it is to Cebu but the fare is almost thrice more expensive? OMG, that&#39;s not reasonable! Why did you choose Dumaguete over Cebu to get to Bohol? Did you not research first?"
"Whoa! I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s that expensive to travel out of Dumaguete! I&#39;m sure it is because of lack of competition. Why did you choose Dumaguete over Cebu to travel to Bohol? Cebu has tons of options and several departures daily (more than 20 by slow and fast ferry combined) to and from Bohol and the rate is twice cheaper. Cebu is the best way to base yourself if you plan to travel to outlying islands and other destinations in all of the Philippines because options are aplenty with several departures daily: fast ferry, slow ferry, pump boat (banca), cruise-type ship, or by air. Rates are even cheaper because of competitions."
Great content! It might be cheap to the foreigners here but if you work here and get a minimum amount of salary you&#39;ll definitely change your perspective.
Try going with Fast Cat. It&#39;s better than most ships! GUARANTEED!
"The real income is 450 peso /day bohol dumaguete is all overpriced, bah hate it."
"yes,i did subscribe..."
Ive been to Panglao Bohol.
Nice trip to bohol guys
TRUE
Bacolod is my place
"&quot;The whiter you are the more expensive it is.&quot;  Lol.  How true!  I&#39;m a Filipino and I have personally witnessed that.  Glad to see that you guys are learning how to haggle (tawad) as you go.  In Philippines,  never settle for the first quoted price, you can always work your way down....or find another.  Enjoy and stay safe!"
Business jack up their price bc of weather is illegal.
"Nice, cozy INNüçª"
Nice video.
you are on the stormy season that is why it very wavy... you forgot to explore siquijor island.. you it is just across bohol... or may take it from dumaguete
Hi guys! been following you for awhile now. If you want more quiet beaches in Bohol you can try Anda. you can stay a day there. I&#39;m wondering if youre going  Cebu. probably go there during the Sinulog on the 21st! :)
That price is like a scam.
"700+ is a day&#39;s work for the middle class Filipinos. But it&#39;s more or less a week or more of work for the working class. It&#39;s why people prefer to use unsafe transportation. Regardless, it&#39;s an archipelago in the middle of two oceans, beset by typhoons at least six times a year.  Inter-island transport is and always will be difficult. Most Filipinos rarely leave the islands they are based in, much less afford trips like El Nido, etc., which is one of the reasons why we like watching these videos. It shows us parts of the country we have never been in and likely never will.<br><br>Also, it may sound counterintuitive, but the larger the boat, the lower the price when it comes to boats larger than the typical Filipino outriggers. It also depends on how many passengers take the route regularly. Fast catamarans are (relatively) cheaper because they travel routes which have tons of passengers. It&#39;s similar to the tricycle vs. jeepney situation. Tricycles are more expensive for the same distance."
That is a very nice place!
nice to see your Phil adventure. Great you found a good accommodation. It&#39;s a shame the ferry charged so much.  Enjoy your trip.
Greedy businessmen do that if no compeptitor. Government dont care
"Bohol is the most backpacker friendly province you can visit. Rent a bike and look for the spots yourself. Anda, Loboc River, Carmen, etc. :) As for the price, skip the crowded beaches. They get a lot of  tour groups there and they pay a premium."
"that is why most foreigners can afford to visit and explore our beautiful sceneries, compared to us who grew up here, who are having a hard time to see the beauty of Philippines because for us it&#39;s too pricey, and we need to prioritize our basic needs, only the well off pinoys can afford to explore our beautiful islands.<br><br>They really charge foreigners with high price because they always think of the dollar exchange rate, which is why most tourists prefer to have a pinoy tourist guide. The tourist guide will guide you with all the right amount of expenses."
"Hello welcome to Panglao, Bohol, enjoy your vacation there. If you don&#39;t mind, may I know the name of the resort? I like the native house where you staying.."
It&#39;s interesting.. in a lot of countries they charge locals less than foreigners.. that would be interesting in the Philippines.
First like here!
Quick question.... What camera do you use to record these videos? Im looking to buy a new one and the one you use seems to have good quality.

Mult succes in continuare si super tare tot ce ati postat in 2017."

"Kinilaw is not like sushi. (Except raw fish)<br> Kinilaw is the Filipino version of Ceviche. The easiest description is raw fish cured with citrus, vinegar and spices."
Not the way we make kinilaw though.
hahaha para sa demonyo üòÇ
The Japanese and Koreans do that too. The only difference is Filipino style is the fish meat was cooked by vinegar.
Try kinilaw with coconut tuno
"Its weird, pork is cheaper than fish. when phils has lots of fish"
Kinilaw the best! Better than adobo

"As a person hus family livelihood related to fish industry, I hav almost tried all types of fish kinilaw. And for me, one of da best fishes to make kinilaw is pandawan/cobia! And we Tausog tribe, partnered it with <del>pyuto</del> steamed hydrated cassava with shredded coconut (in visaya, puto balanghoy) For us, kinilaw + pyuto is heaven!"

It&#39;s better you cook it like adobo ingredients¬†or fry it.
"Be careful to your stomach not used to,¬†avoid diarrhea from the raw fish. Not drinking water after eating only beer or 7 up."

"You have poor descriptions/narrations though. Should have been a narrative vlog though, not a magic mike full of english men though"

I really like kinilaw... Mas masarap Kung kalamansi nilagay Nila  instead of vinegar... Taz may konting luya... Yummyyyyy... (well... That&#39;s only my opinion based on my experienced)..‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è..

Kinilaw is more like ceviche üòä
Vitsin is MSG.. lol
"They said that by adding vinegar and lime it kinda uses its acidity to cook the fish on its own,but its not the same as real cooking,also they said that msg is not good to consume when not cooked because it stays in the brain so I dont know...üôÑ"
You&#39;re suppose to leave that fish in vinegar for 5 minutes  before put those condiments.. Means wash the fish with vinegar first then put new vinegar.
"One of my favorite group of people. Handsome, fun-loving, not &quot;maarte&quot;, humble with an adventurous spirit! You know we Filipinos appreciate the most those who never forget to look back to their roots. Love y&#39;all, and keep the good vibes up! Take care and have fun in your journeys! Thank you."

Before your blog not like this so called in Tagalog jologs but when the time you colaborate with kulas nagiging jologs na rin ang mag blogs mo.
"Time is not gold; not money. Time is more valuable than both. When you lose gold &amp; money you can earn them back but when you waste time, it is irredeemable. So here is the deal. Do not invest time on activities &amp; stuff that would not add value to your success goals. Reassess your many activities, eliminate those that are merely time wasters &amp; use productively only on those what would help you attain success and growth. - Francis Kong <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PassionPurposeProductivity"">#PassionPurposeProductivity</a>"

What i would recommend doing before making kinilaw is washing the fish in sea water one last time. Just in case the flies did some damage while the fish was being cut and all."
No need vetsin in the kinilaw bcoz it‚Äôs already taste like have vetsin on it...
I miss the OG!!! Bring back IMA or JD. :)

"hahaha wash your hand first in sea water,, :D nice"
"sea foods are cooked easily most specially if marinated with vinegar, the acid in the vinegar will slowly cook the sea food, and kill the bacteria that are present on it."

Love your show. Better then Mark Weins
I love oyster and I&#39;ve always wanted to try tamilok since watching Aga Muhlach ate one on a show üòÑ
Wow only 100 pesos/4 dollars for a bag of slimy wood snail/clam/worms‚Ä¶ How awesome‚Ä¶ If I go back there I will bring that home as a gift for my American friends and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll love it‚Ä¶ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ sure they taste sweet like nothing but wood pulp slime.. oh I am sure the vinegar really helps‚Ä¶ Come on Filipinos this is just disgusting‚Ä¶ and of course in the silliest accent there is speaking English‚Ä¶ Yes I make fun of my Filipino relatives‚Ä¶ Delicious? Get the fuck out of here‚Ä¶ü§¨ü§Æ do they really taste like freshwater clams? Since they say they are technically clams‚Ä¶ I mean if they taste like clams then it might be OK‚Ä¶ But the texture is like an earthworm‚Ä¶ Maybe if you fry it up like a clam strip you won&#39;t know. And if you&#39;re in your hotel room with lots of stamina‚Ä¶ The Philippines makes it really easy to order up a girl or two or three or maybe a boy if you like‚Ä¶ Disgusting. Yep as I expected ..it&#39;s better friedüëçüèº
"Right‚Ä¶ Eating those wood worms or whatever they&#39;re  called‚Ä¶ I&#39;m sure they build up your sexual stamina‚Ä¶ And I&#39;m sure they give you a rock hard erection right? Then why not bring that worm into bed with you‚Ä¶ All you need to get a good erection is a beautiful woman‚Ä¶ with a brain, personality and little clothingüòÅNot your partner that you are probably tired of by now after how many years‚Ä¶ Just kiddingüòâ"
I really want fry coconut worms but I scared of bugs and worms but eating something should make me less fearful right !!? Also I would so love to experience real life in other countries their everyday norms!‚ù§love what this guy is doing .
Wow. Umm first I&#39;m sorry to say ewww! Then my favorite worm is the one on a hook at the end of my line! Tons of respect to you sonny!

My favorite worm is the gummy worm.üòéüòÅ
&quot; what happens when you are alone in your hotel with loads of stamina. &quot; HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
These wooden worms can grow up to the size of snakes with their own shells. Small tamiloks at least look  okay to eat but giant ones with shells look terrifying. Not sure if local people also eat those snake-like tamiloks.
I wish red bandana nerd gets rid of that.  I like the footage but not that guy!!!
"Seriously, aren&#39;t people afraid of catching diseases by eating this?  Wild animals have been responsible for many deadly infections, like HIV and ebola. Also, what about water born illnesses. I&#39;d never walk barefoot in that water.  Think I&#39;ll stick to my tofu and broccoli!  Pass the perrier, please.  Great show BTW!!!"

"bro&#39;s pretty brave, even i won&#39;t eat such a thing *cries"
I am from the Philippines.  I heard of &quot;tamilok&quot; but I have never eaten that damn wormwood!
"If you imagine the worm to be a sea worm, then eating it raw wouldn&#39;t seem so bad. It would be like eating sashimi. But if you have to see how it&#39;s caught, the appetite disappears and turns into horror."

"I‚Äôd throw up ü§Æ wayyy before I even thought about eating it. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not a male that worries about stamina. The ones that were breaded looked much easier to eat , still do know if I‚Äôd eat any of it."

"I think the most mind-blowing part is that those damned things are clams....like...what the fuck? I don&#39;t know man, I don&#39;t know that I could do it raw. I think every time some guy (like me) says, &quot;I don&#39;t really want to eat that&quot; another guy tell him that it&#39;s good for his manhood. That&#39;s a sure-fire way to get a dude to do anything üòÜ"

"As a filipino, i kinda like this. I sometimes eat this as a snack or dinner with my family. Yes, it&#39;s kina weird and disgusting to find this worms especially if you&#39;re not use to it but trust it taste great. All you have to do is to cook it carefully. We don&#39;t eat it raw cuz it&#39;s disgusting we COOK it guys don&#39;t worry."

I use to live in Philippine but I move to the U.S. and it‚Äôs boring I don‚Äôt know what to do staying hereüôÅ
&quot;Tamilok&#39;&#39; is a specie of seafood where &#39;&#39;Clams&#39;&#39; belong.

Good day to you Sonny. I love most you vlogging in our country üáµüá≠.  Especially in Palawan. Am also a curious person that is why I also love watching different kinds of exotic food in different place. Just keep up the good work and to God be the glory!üôèüôèüôèüçÄüçÄüçÄ

Lechon is the best tasting pork meal ever. I wont eat Tamilok even if Im a Filipino
"even though im a filipino, I can&#39;t eat raw foods like that, more likely any sorts of kinilaw"
"As a filipino, I know tamilok from KMJS show which featured this kind of species called by locals as tamilok, but has a english term of shipwreck worms, which scientist belief has a good source of protein."
This is the most disgusting video!

"Asians really have funny beliefs in eating wild food for bedroom stamina, its really disgusting n funny"

"Even Philippines is my home land but it&#39;s my first seeing such kind of worm and be eaten , hehehe !"
"Home quarantine coz of covid-19!!

"I cant stop watching your videos. Not only food reviews, but its the culture and we&#39;re learning something. Thanks. Godbless your travels."
I&#39;m Filipino and I remember the first time I tasted tamilok was when I visited there also in Palawan. It&#39;s actually pretty expensive in the small carinderia where we stopped over and actually it tasted like clams. I didn&#39;t eat it whole instead I cut it and mix it with rice. It tasted OK üëåüèª

Your stamina superb. I always follow your video.
Much more related to an oyster or clam. The wood if sawn is beautieful red color mangrove hardwood. Makes a very nice pirates chest or table. I have also made doors from the wood.
I love this show and have recommended it to friends but what‚Äôs the deal with the red bandana in every episode? Is there a story behind it?
Another bear christ. lol

No answer here. But as for my LEAST favourite kind of worms? All of the polychaetes. I mean, have you SEEN the &quot;bobbit worm&quot;? Ewww....."
I‚Äôm gonna be visiting the Philippines next year. This is on my bucket list

Asians really know how to con naive Westerners. Say something is great for the libido and it will sell to men like crazy. So they will say that literally everything they cook and sell gives you a strong libido to rake in the cash. It&#39;s all BS and gullible Western men &quot;eat&quot; it all up.<br><br> Another thing my Filipino friends will do is pick something up in their home that looks old and like an heirloom and they&#39;ll place it in their Canadian/Americans friends hands and say it was passed down from &quot;generation to generation&quot; and they&#39;ll all be oohing and awing and gushing over this trinket they actually bought or picked out of the garbage a few days before. Then they all have a good laugh about it after their Western friends have left.<br><br> They find it patronizing how we automatically assume that just because they are of Asian heritage they know about &quot;ancient medicine&quot; and magical foods. So they f*ck with us.
"Lemme tell you something, everything in philippines is cheap"

I heard of place in Balabac were Turtle eggs are eaten. I believe they are farm raised so it doesn&#39;t keep the ocean in an unbalanced state. Thanks again for the videos. We need this type food very local food content."

"Taste like regret! hahaha<br><br>Also, you have not tried the original version of Sisig... it originated from our province called Pampanga, the culinary capital of the Philippines. The Sisig you have tried so many times are those like &quot;make my own version of sisig kinda style&quot; lol<br><br>Seriously, go to Pampanga and we&#39;ll indulge you with some stuffed frogs or what we call &quot;Betute Tugak&quot; Some Mole Crickets or locally known as &quot;Kamaru&quot;. I know you have tried rats, snakes and a lot of exotic foods but i promise you, you have not tasted them just right like how we do it, our local cuisine is our pride!<br><br>One advice though, if ever you get tipsy in Pampanga, make sure you are not near rice fields or corn fields where you might walk and stumble... locals catch everything that moves and crawls that will end up in a plate! lol<br><br>I hope you get a chance to visit one day...<br><br>Luid ka Pampanga!"

I love the funny sides in every of your videos.. Good humor Axe Men&#39; and the &#39;stamina&#39;  üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ

From a Filipino: I HEARD ITS DELICIOUS
What&#39;s next Poop with gravy and rice
I would like to stay with your adventure and eat this type of challenging food!!!
"I live in Philippines, Palawan is maganda (beautiful)"
Make a show in indian food bro
Well...<br>First thing is..<br>I Don‚Äôt know that worm thing..<br>2nd things is I‚Äôm a filipino..<br>3rd things is..<br>WHO THE HELL WILL EAT THOSE DISGUSTING FOOD?! EVEN I DON‚ÄôT EAT THOSE!
Why doesn&#39;t it move? üòÆ
The aXe Man

A bitch would be running!!
That&#39;s really  nasty
i there you to go in boracay
i would rather eat the bark from where those creatures came from
&quot;taste like regret&quot;üòÇ<br>I tried it before but I just can&#39;t swallow it. I need to eat savory food afterwards to get rid of the after taste.
Nasty!!
a tamilok was found at sultan kudarat and it is lots of times bigger than that
Whats up bro im filipino i almost tried to find tamilok but its so hard your so lucky because you find tamilok
I thought he might become Andrew&#39;s heir to Bizarre Foods----NOPE!
It taste like regret
Respect! ü§Æ
Exotic food is not for everyone. I am one of those who would probably rather¬†starve to death than eating crawling creatures.
And here i am scared if oinions&#39;-&#39;.
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s our scariest food here. If you&#39;re still in the Phil you might want to try &#39;dagang bukid&#39; or those frogs from rice fields. If you like to try more tamilok we have those giant tamilok that can be seen in the sea instead.
Taste like... Regret deym hahahahahaha
"pagnagbota ka dyan, lulubog yang bota mo tapos mahirap kunin kasi nga putik yan. Kaya kelangan magpaa. Sa mga hindi makagets kung bakit sya nagpaa, ayan. mas madali dba."

My favorite worm is my boyfriend&#39;s üòÇ
"Fantastic job on this vid. You&#39;re pretty amazing... and brave. I was just there two weeks ago and had the opportunity to try these worms. I couldn&#39;t do it. By the way, please stay safe when you do this. I was horrified when you took your shoes off while trekking through the jungle. You might not get so lucky next time and pick up some sort of parasite or get bitten by some wild critter. Take care and keep up the good work.  üëè"
Ok even as a Filipino I&#39;m kinda scared :&#39;D
Just saying.. You should never wear a black shirt to somewhere with mosquito bites disease... They are attracted to dark colored clothing. üëç
"You should not dump it in the dirty water <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MovIpxxyOlo&amp;t=6m18s"">6:18</a>"

"Lol , what&#39;s it taste ? It taste like regret u killed me hhh"

"So far I&#39;ve only watched two of your vids but I&#39;m really enjoying them. If you saying &quot;If I&#39;m honest&quot; isn&#39;t a catchphrase, I guess it just popped up a lot in the two videos I&#39;ve watched! If I&#39;m honest, I&#39;ve subscribed and I&#39;ll keep watching."
gross!üòù

"Those wood worms.Salute to you for having such a daring heart to eat those exotic delicacies,,"
"That&#39;s fascinating, you&#39;re so brave :D (People who think this is ridiculous, they don&#39;t want to try anything new and they just ain&#39;t riighhhttttttt) lmho my favorite worm are those green fluffy worms XD (But not to eat them lol)"

Admired this channel for experiencing!
My favorite kind of worms are Gummy Worms üòÜ
"When I was a 10 year old kid, 60 years ago, I&#39;d have chowed down on these things for sure. 50 years ago, age 20, maybe. 40 years ago, age 30, fried. Maybe fried, with sweet onion and breaded, and maybe a tequila chaser. Today, age 70+, NO WAY IN HELL! I&#39;m old enough to know what I like, and that worm isn&#39;t one of them. Serve them up for Diversity Training seminars and shame the snowflakes into eating them, not just one at a time, but¬†by the handful."
Amazing !!
I ate that when im in palawan. Taste so good. üòÜ
it&#39;s an aphrodisiac. It&#39;s called &quot;wood&quot; worm for a reason - you&#39;ll get wood.
my gf said she liked my worm better and still she wants more she could not get satisfied and kept coming back for more LOL
"Beautifully shot and love the ambience, it‚Äôs exciting to see exotic food and the process to get it. This is my first video that i watch from your page but not even halfway through i‚Äôve clicked the subscribe button xD love your channel!!"

"I admire Americans like you who are willing to explore and learn other cultures, instead of criticizing them for their &quot;unusual&quot; diet. Some people just are too limited to understand that food is also a part of culture, and not the same everywhere.  Being Pinoy I have tried many kinds of exotic foods in many parts of the world, but have not tried tamilok. Maybe I should next time I take a vacation in the Philippines again."
I love the way the guide says &#39;&#39;Yaaa&#39;&#39;

Brave Man Sonny!
"It looks like nasty, but deliciouso  the best ever food review.. Sonny Super thumbs up..."
"Just saying, these aren&#39;t worms but more closely related to mussles and clams :D"
Thank you Sonny and team for documenting this. I know its hard and tough. But this is awesome as always!
Eat a giant tamilok!
Omg!!  Youre in Palawan!  My province!!  Super excited!!
"Hahaha this guy is pangbihira&#39; kakain ng kilawin pero hnd nya dinura, <br>kahit na hindi nya talaga gusto, <br>patunay yan na may respeto sya saten,, <br>sa pagkain pa lang db lalo na siguro sa personal,<br>sana matikman pa nya mga food trip natin dto sa pinas"
This channel is living up to its name.
Giardia Bisque üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Earthworm

"Damn bro, that axemen (xmen) joke made me cringe because they have no idea about that punch line üòÇ"
They are <b>AXE</b>-perts<br><br><b>badumtsss</b>
great food adventure bro....my fave worm is gummy worm!!! HA3
Please visit palaweno brewery and try their different beer varieties. It‚Äôs also known as ayahay beer their coconut rhum is one of the best
Another good video! Keep up the good work! Love your channelüòÅ
My favourite worm is that when anyone is eating it
They should have never given the worm name to these creatures because that grosses people out. I&#39;m surprised rarely anyone has noticed they are saltwater clams. So you are actually correct to say they taste like snails/oyster. <br>They resemble the thin razor clams.<br><br>I want to try one but looks like I have to travel to Phillipines. Oysters don&#39;t taste the best either by itself but it depends how it&#39;s cleaned. I wonder if they have a rubber feel if they are cooked.
"Man this year is gunna be big for you. This is such a unique sort of channel and it really is good, good job, bud üòÅ"
"Bro, you play the best music.  Where do you get your songs from?"
Amazing video!
"Dude, i found out about you like 2 weeks ago, and have watched almost every video. I need more content!!! &lt;3"
Damn some of those worms were huge.<br>When you get back to Vietnam you should keep doing vids with the girls you had in the seafood challenge video. Many of your best/funniest vids are with them :)
&quot;it taste like regret&quot; üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
We also have it here in aklan. We don&#39;t clean the poop out when we eat them though; gives the worm a woody tasteüòÅ
haha my god
Wow your food video on strange food is awesome. I admire your bravery on eating those disgusting looking worms. Its fun to watch and very educating. <br>üíûüòç
"Haha if you want to try something a bit more extreme, try the food in the mountains, like pinikpikan and etag. It&#39;s not so much about the ingredients, but how those foods are traditionally prepared lol. Great episode btw, giardia bisque had me cackling. Maybe cholera  stew next?"
You&#39;re so awesome man I salute you for that.
I‚Äôve eaten at kinabuch before and I love their food!!!
"There‚Äôs actually another guy with them that‚Äôs walking bare foot, he‚Äôs carrying a camera<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23respect2cameraman"">#respect2cameraman</a>"

"Wood worm = 1, Sonny = 0 lol"
It tastes like <b>REGRET</b>
"THAT IS HOW YOU SHOULD EAT EXOTIC FOOD!!! One should hunt exotic food in order to eat it. You don&#39;t buy exotic food on the market, WFT, there is no satisfaction in that. Maybe for those who plan on just tasting it, it is ok to just buy it. I remember hunting for frogs after the heavy rain; laying traps for wild birds; cutting palm trees for the Beatles to lay their eggs, and then cracking it if the larvae are big enough. I remember checking our traps in the morning and gathering the prize, after that climbing mango trees to gather green mangos as garnish; climbing coconut trees for sum fresh bukos, and lastly sweet potatoes and/or unripe bananas. I miss those days."
‚ÄúIs he gonna eat it now?‚Äù LOL üòÇ That courage though!
"hahaha,, those reaction"
This video was so worth the wait.
Johnson the worm
I could not
"Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, i think i‚Äôve watch all of your video and I repeat it coz let‚Äôs be honest, you make me laugh !!!! Good job"

Tapeworms
"Yeahhhh.....I&#39;m not eating thatüò∑. I enjoyed the video though, keep them coming."

If it‚Äôs scariest why would you eat it
You should come back to Minnesota and do a video of the food here! üòÖ
"Go to South America and find an Anaconda, Sonny vs Anaconda life and death eat off. j/k"
The book worm üêõ
"I appreciate what you do, super entertaining Sonny! Please do more, lots to see and show in the Philippines."
"First time i heard about people eating worms I thought I was being pranked. I was little. I am terrified of worms, I really don&#39;t like them. So i really can&#39;t watch these kind of videos."
You‚Äòre awesome Sonny. I envy what you‚Äôre doing.

Wow!
"I&#39;m a Palawe√±o but been away for so long from my beloved hometown. That man who axed the log and simply eat the tamilok out there is my nephew. Tamilok in my heydays are bigger, longer and cleaner. Unlike those ones in the video. Because there&#39;s a lot of logs out there before. Logs that are not immersed in mud have clean tamilok."
No guts no glory.
Thanks Sonny

Upon checking the mangrove forests, they saw some locals slurping through some woodworm. And while Joe was watching in amazement on how satisfied the locals looked after eating, he called out his friend and said &quot;Tammy look!&quot;...<br>Hahahaha!"

I love jollibee best fried chicken ever
"you forgot their mango peach pies, spaghetti and palabok )-:"
Mix the halo halo first before eating it..thats why its called mix mix
To eat halohalo you have to mix it first. Halohalo means mix.
Try adobo rice
stir the halo halo it taste better.  by the way halo halo means mix mix.
Your gf looks high af lol
i dont know why americans dont really mixed their foods.. when food is all about the mix of flavors
Youre doing it wrong on halo-halo. You gotta mix it well
Pls mix everything in eating halo halo üòäüëçüèª
Of all the jolibee reactions i watch urs was the one fun to watch... Everyone loves jolibee
üëèüëèüëè
you&#39;re eating the halo-halo the wrong way. you have to mix it very well to get the real filipino taste. just saying üòò
in the name of sarah geronimo ahahaahaha
Hardly anyone ever mixes the halo-halo well when they first try it. Sometimes even the palabok.  They should have a sign at Jollibees which stuff to mix before eating. Lol!
Im a new Fan fr Philippines! Appreciate ur Patronage!
The best time to visit is from January to may as summer time season...
You should mix the halo halo coz it literally means mix mix...
Jollibee is made for kids and families. esp kids bday. for kids for real
You look like pewdiepie
u should try the peach mango pie too.......<br><br>üòÅüòÅüòÅ
your girl maybe a filipino by soul coz she keeps dipping everything in gravy
Does jollihotdog scary?? How? Why? It is just a food.. Does it look like horror thing? Arte naman NG girl..

"You should mix the halo halo so you can get the real taste, its yummy"
have to mix up the halo halo!!!!
Your mukbang is much better if the camera angle sees the whole food.
guyz the halo2x you need to mix it..halo2x means mix2x.
This girl is sooo annoying...<br>Maarte!!!!!
How&#39;s a sauce gonna scare you??????
"This was on my recommendation again, May 20. I really hope that chicken sandwich gets on our Philippine menu."
"you should try palabok but before you eat it mix it well add kalamansi,"
"halo halo means mix mix, you half to mix it well before you eat it, you will appreciate it very much"
Lol &quot;in the name of Sarah Geronimo&quot; ü§£ü§£ü§£.. love your reaction
Wut! No spaghetti?

"to taste the goodness,of that halo halo (mix mix) u have to mix all the ingredients guys... mix those then taste it like milk shake.. that purple color is Ube flavored ice cream... ube is like a violet sweet potato version.."

This made me crave for Jollibee even more. So annoyed that there still no Jollibee anywhere in Australia.
You look like the person who is in Exploring with Cody
Halo halo is the  best here in Philippines...
I don&#39;t get how a yellow sauce scares you.
So close on getting that youtube play button 100k subs!
Pineapple Juice makes cums sweet.lul

The mayo sauce on the hot dog is crazy delicious. Im still not even sure its mayo
Just so violating... eating the toppings of a halo halo. I feel like i have seen such huge crime. Hahaha! Please!!! Come to the PH!!
"My favorite from Jollibee is the freaking CHICKEN JOY<br>Its crunchy, juicy, soft, flavorful, tender, CRISPY"
"Why am I watching this at 11 36 pm, Im getting so hungry<br>Btw Im Filipino"
"so far this the best reaction video i&#39;ve ever watched, two thumbs up!"

Mix your &quot;Halo-Halo&quot;... in english Mix-Mix
I also dip the fries in gravy!!! Y&#39;all should also try every filipino street food. Highly suggested guys.<br><br>Ps. You have to mix every ingredients in the halo-halo.
I just like the skinü§£
Try the Palabok and the Amazing aloha burger.
Most American likes Jollibee peach mango pie. Try it.
Halo halo Means mix mix. U have to mix it üôÇ
"Lol. Watching this while eating Jollibee Palabok and Chicken Joy, and a cold bottle of Stella Artois to wash it all down. Awesome vid!"
Yummy jollinee..I luv it..I luv u zac üòçüòçüòç
"HALO-HALO means MIX/MIX-MIX. the name itself tells you everything about it. It was called mix-mix or halo-halo because of its mixture of ingredients as you can see there&#39;s a lot of different stuffs in there, a mixture of different ingredients. Now the way how you are supposed to eat it is in its name &quot;MIX-MIX&quot; mix it well and then enjoy. If you want to know more how it was done just watch it in youtube."
"Spicy chicken joy, jolly spaghetti, hotdog, palabok and the macaroni soup üòç<br>Love it!"
It was a shit storm after
sara geroimo...racist x 100... looking like an idiot didnt excuse him
&quot;In the name of Sarah Geronimo&quot; LOL

More videos like this
"Jollibee in the Philippines doesn‚Äôt even have that burger you just ate and the portions here are really small (e.g. peach mango pie), I‚Äôm afraid you might get disappointed just like Layna Fable did on her channel. üòÖ Glad you guys liked it though. :)"
This makes me hungry! üòã
Hey Zach thanks a lot for your great reaction of Jolibee... You can come to the Philippines anytime just like HugKnucklesTV did... I bet they&#39;ve enjoyed their stay in our country... üòä
"That sweet Halo-halo dessert literally means mix-mix means mixed sweets consists of milk, crushed ice, egg custard ( that yellow color ), kaong (sweet processed coconut ) , shredded young coconut ( tastes better than coconuts sold in western countries ), sweet beans and ube ( violet sweetened root crop , violet is the natural color of ube ) topped with ube ice cream."
you must try halo-halo @ Buenavista Agusan Del Norte Philippines better than jolibee halo-halo..
"i swear after i get my first salary,,, i&#39;ll go to jollibee"
"Please do come, it‚Äôs more FUN in the Philippines, a million things you will enjoy there, the beautiful islands and friendly people. Thanks for sharing, thumbs up"
JOLLIBEE is the NO.1 fastfood on the Philippines. It&#39;s affordable and very delicious.üòäüòäüòä<br>I love watching you both eating jollibee.üòÜüòÜüòÜ<br>I love spicy chickenjoy and aloha burger.üçî
I always reserve the chicken skin as my last bite. And dude! The chicken sandwich looks so appetizing but that&#39;s not the kind of chicken sandwich we have here in the Philippines. Jollibee&#39;s version there in the U.S. looks so much better.<br>Your kids look adorable!
Well I didn&#39;t know that Jollibee has chicken sandwich
Glad you got to try Jollibee with your fam!  That&#39;s awesome!
in the name of sarah GeronimoüòÇ

"Jollibee smells so freaking good, sometimes im at the road just casually passing by at jollibee but u can still smell the food in there. But yea, i agree that jollibee in other countries are better than the ones that we havr here in the Philippines. I also want to try those chicken dippers."

Hi Zach..looking forward on your trip to PI. Do a meet and greet then I&#39;m willing to tour you in Manila..
You shouldnt have included her in the show. She is just messing it up by being so picky and bratty.
"Awesome you guys love Jollibee! :) Try getting the Jollibee Spaghetti, Palabok, Aloha Yum burger &amp; Peach Mango pie :D"
Great stuff Guys..  Its good to see you introducing Filipino food to non-Pinoy market. Thats something a Filipino will be appreciative of.  Good luck to your youtube journey.

Halo-halo needs to be mixed thoroughly (halo == mixed) ^_^

"That music after sipping pineapple juice, I know what that means LOL! Btw, subbed and liked this video."
The biggest mistake in eating halo-halo is not mixing it thoroughly. That&#39;s what the name &quot;halo-halo&quot; means. Mix-mix.
"Haha! just hearing Zach keep repeating the word &#39;DUDE&#39;, reminds me of the movie &#39;Dude, where&#39;s my car?&#39; haha love your vids man."
"You guys are so lovely to watch,  you look like a kid again just enjoying the food. Much love from Middle East.  üëåüëçüíûüíïüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶"

You should try the Pancit Palabok.
Go to the Philippines in December or February it&#39;s not so hot just humid. You&#39;ll enjoy the food there and the hospitality of the people of the Philippines.
"I&#39;m glad you love jollibee! That&#39;s also my favorite fast food chain here in the Philippines!! And for the Halo-halo, you&#39;re supposed to mix them together. Halo means &#39;mix&#39; in English. üòÑüòÑüòÑ so literally it means &#39;mix-mix&#39;"

jollibee philippines doesn&#39;t have halo-halo on their menu
Hey zach! Jollibee is like the oxygen of the filipinos. You should try the chicken with rice. Burger steak is amazing too. Please notixe me. From the Philippines
"You looked so nice guys ,, its more fun in the philippines , your handsome and pretty guys"
Why all these videos keep eating halo halo the wrong way. Mix them before eating. Kinda frustrating haha.
Jollibee is my comfort food.

halo-halo ...you should mix it :) halo means mix
"Wow where is th spaghetti.? You guys just went to Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower. Chicken Joy and Sphaghetti is the two giant trademarks of jollibee.. Most children likes the spaghetti, The halo halo. You can eat the flan and ice cream at the top But. It‚Äôs a mortal sin not to mix it. The sugar and other ingredients are at the bottom. The top is mostly shaved ice."
Your daughter in her cute little leather jacket! Also you have to mix up that halo2! Subscribing after this comment! Cant wait for your videos when y&#39;allz come to the philippines!
Cornbeef sliders with gravy.
"Should try spghetti,aloha burger and spicy chicken. Halo halo literally means mix mix so you have to mix everything to enjoy it. :) also try the corned beef and spam sandwich and oh peach mango pie :)"
"Filipino spaghetti is sweater and the jolli-hotdogs as well coz we&#39;re mostly using Banana ketchup. That thing I must admit that Americans most probably doesnt like! :)) , but the chicken dipping it with their gravy surely even non Filipino would love if they&#39;re not too too too picky with their food or if someone that doesnt want to try other food culture outside their own..."
i can eat rice with jollibee gravy alone hahahahahaa
Zack lookin like Ethan Hawke
"Your sister is very pretty, especially, when she‚Äôs eating chicken."

You need to mix the halo-halo from top to bottom.. Hence the name mix-mix..
"I just woke up,and watching them eat..i wanna drive from bed to Jollibee...now!!!"
I love jolibee!!!
So sad there&#39;s no peach mango pie :( that&#39;s the real bomb!
Hope to see yaaah both here in thw philippines...
Jollibee used to be for the kids before they expand but since a lot of people most specially who grow up eating Jollibee when they&#39;re young
Halo literally means mix. U have to mix the halo halo all together before u eat it
Ill always love you :)
the look in her face when you took off the skin. haha
Sarah geronimo happens to be the main endorser of jolibee üòä
I like Alyssa&#39;s reaction on the hotdog lol. Im not a fan of their hotdog too.
you may also try jollibee spaghetti and aloha burger...it is best to sip pineapple juice right after eating each food and you will be surprised with the outcome..halo halo or mix mix in english term as the word mix meaning mix all of the stuff inside...
In General the Jollibee in the States is much more better in Philippines..
You guys look stoned
"We do not have chicken dippers and chicken sandwich here in the Philippines. It is so unfair! Anyways, we can order it in McDonalds. Haha"
From One Ok Rock to this &quot;damn! Im ma get my &quot;JABI&quot; now. <br><br>One of the best reviewers out there.<br><br>Keep it going sir!

Other Filipino Fastfood you need to try would be Chowking ( A Filipino -Chinese Fastfood) also owned by Jollibee foods corp. for Desserts.. you need to try Red Ribbon Bakeshop
Halo Halo means MIX MIX so the right way to eat that dessert is to mix all ingredients first before  eating it.
"You got to try The AMAZING ALOHA BURGER.. It&#39;s a big Burger with pineapple on it and you also need to get the all time favorite PEACH MANGO PIES.. Other stuffs you missed trying is the Burger Steak,  Sweet Spaghetti, Spicy Chicken Joy, Pancit Palabok, SPam Sandwiches, Sundaes."
mix your halo-halo first b4 eating
OMG. U ATE THE HALO-HALO WRONG!!! DUDE!! you were supposed to mix it all up first.
Ohh my i need to go jollibee after watching you guys!!!!
"That was crazy! I always wanted to try jollibee here in Chicago but that freaking line is not even funny!<br>The way u guys ate it,,ummm it&#39;s not fake u really enjoying It"

New subscriber here..from Philippines..<br><br><br>Both of you so cute and I like your video
are u guys Filipino I&#39;m new here on ur channel..
Trying to be Filipino bro?
You need to practice eating with a spoon and fork. The spoon is in the right hand and the fork is in the left hand. Spear the meat with the fork and use the edge of the spoon to cut the meat into smaller pieces. Then use the spoon to gather rice and different meal components for one mouthful of all the different items so you can taste everything at once. Practice Filipino style cutlery. <br><br>Next you can try eating with one leg perched on the chair you&#39;re sitting on. LOL (only do that at home)
You dont like penakbet ..Bro..
i am now your avid subscriber because you always feature Filipino dishes...
use spoon bro.
Hey plz react to btsüò≠üôè<br>Plz plz

this video makes me sooo hungry ü§§ü§§ü§§ hahaha wwhhyyyyyy üò≠üò≠üò≠ btw. thank you for trying our traditional foods üòÑüòÑüòÑ
"Filipino food with rice is everything. Had my breakfast already but this made me hungry again. Hahaha <br><br>Thank you so much for trying Filipino foods. I hope you enjoyed them. <br><br>Sorry if didn&#39;t reply regarding what Filipino food you should try. Well there a lots of good traditional or classic FILO foods but my best picks are: Kare-Kare, sinigang (either pork, fish or shrimp), adobo (chicken or pork), sisig, pancit, dinuguan, chapseuy. Snacks or kakanin: puto, bibingka, suman, ensaymada, turon, kamote/banana que. I think that&#39;s all for now. <br><br>Looking forward to your next and upcoming episodes. Thank you again."
All the love from your filipino subscribers!üòÑ‚ù§
Its nice to know that you enjoy the food üôÇ
Best video ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shawn ! Hope you‚Äôre doing good my friend! I see I got some haters lol üòÇ
Bitter Melon is my is my Favy üòçüòçüòç
That stupid guide gave you food even most Filipinos don‚Äôt like eating. Giving a first timer bitter melon?! Are you freakin‚Äô kidding me?!
you should eat balot üòÖüòäüòänice videoüòäüòò
greatest video I ever seen...
"Balot ,litson baboy,nilaga na manok na may gata at crispy pata"
"bitter melon, at least they were honest about it hahahaha"
The first one that he ate is ampalaya it&#39;s bitter and plus very healthy and make u strong # I am Philipino
"Try to eat Lechon, pork sisig, pork liempo, paella, leche flan. Durian candies, ripe mangoes from guimaras or zambales... <br><br>Aside from different varieties of fruits like, guyabano, dragon fruit, durian etc. and vegies from baguio city, and sagada oranges and green magoes with bagoong, tuna fish from gensan and more to eat only in the Philippines."
Lechon cebu and belly
love this
Just try the balut it is awesome
An American who has never heard of Empanada must be very stupid. And Filipinos who think Empanada is so Filipino must be very ignorant of his own culture and the existence of Latin America.
Some Philippino is great but I would never eat dinuguan it is made from blood? The scripture clearly states:-<br>‚Äúthat you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and <br>from what has been strangled and from fornication.&quot;
Can you tell me where is this restaurant in LA
Pilipino food is a bomb??? Thanks for all...
U think u like it pilipino foodüç¥üçïüçî?
"This is so goooood! üòçüòçüòç when you visit the Philippines, you try street food like fishballs, kwek kwek, kikiam and many more... üòçüòçüòç"
"Try the manggoes with bagoong,,sinigang and sisig."
I think the girl your with needs to practice her roots.
Tons of foods bro. When you get to the Philippines variety of local and international cuisine like eating at the  <br>buffet resto.

I been coming to the Philippines for twenty years now I still won&#39;t try balot
I personally don&#39;t like balot
Philippino food is gross. They eat parts of animals that would turn your stomach inside out. Chicken intestines? I don&#39;t think so.
Tuslob buwa
"Just eat ,chicken head,intestine,blood,and feet,,,üòÇ it&#39;s  yummyüòã"

Bitter melon 8s good especially if your anemic
Awesome video. Got hungry by watching it.
thank you for trying our food in philipines salamat
You must tru eat balot..... and PALAPA
"Everybody here seems to say a lot of filipino dishes, well why not try eating jumping salad, its a fresh  small shrimp, No need to cook, just fresh! with vinegar salt, ginger, onions and chilis or siling labuyo, ang tatampal, its a kind of sea food similar to lobster. and Diningding.....oh man, that is so delicous, eating it with warm rice and roast pork.. my mouth is already watering he he he"
Sisig is pretty good!
"Rather than name the Philippine dishes you should try you should try watching Filipino food 101 as posted by First We Feast with Jo Koy, a native Filipino. All of the main dishes are included on this short video."
"Everybody that posts a video about trying  Philippine  food goes right to the &quot;balut&quot; issue. The  Philippine people make some great food but even the most exotic of world gastronomic travelers say that you must know who you are buying your &quot;balut&quot; from. It needs to be a certain number of days old. If it goes past the recommended number of days that is where you get the feathers and bones. Even Jo Koy, who was raised in the Philippines said &quot; we didn&#39;t eat that shit. We could afford eggs&quot;. It is a national dish but not everyone born and raised in the Philippines is a fan."
IF YOU WANT AUTHENTIC FILIPINO DISHES GET THE PORK ADOBO OR CHICKEN ADOBO I PREFER THE PORK GET THE DINUGUAN ITS CHOCOLATE MEAT AND POUR IT OVER HOT STEAMED RICE AND TRY THE SISIG AND LECHON KAWALI THE ROASTED PORK BELLY ITS BOMB
"try pagpag,, its free..."
You need to try soup #5 in binondo or black chicken soup aswell
"yeah send your item to LBC, and your doomed"
She&#39;s too Americanized. Go to Philippines and hang out with locals. They can show you the real deal over there.
"Eat balot, isaw, chicken blood."
Balut
"Try the ILOCOS Food like <br>Vigan Empanada<br>Langgonisa<br>Pampanga Food are bumb too<br>Like TOCINO,  LANGONISA,  TAPA<br>Tagaygay City - BULALO<br>bacolod City - Bacolid Chicken Inasal,  Cansi Variety Like - sisig cansi,  curry cansi,  and a lot more..."
"All grilled seafood,and grilled chicken,and grilled pork,of course our famous desserts"
how about doing a google search and find actual location of resto in the mall instead of walking aound in circles? You guys live in the digital world its easy to figure out.
Uhhhh..... I just like the barbeque

Balut
If you plan a trip  to Silang/Tagaytay area in Cavite eat at LZM. They&#39;ve got the best bangus(milkfish) there. Their menu is absolutely mouth- watering lol!
"The best food to eat is in &quot;PAMPANGA&quot; where the best chefs in the Philippines are located.  &quot;Sisig&quot;, Kalderetang Kambing (Spicy geot stew), Crab Roe, Blood Stew(Dinuguan), etc.  Cebu would also be a good place to eat the best &quot;Lechon (whole roasted pig). Happy eating."
come to my hometown! pampanga (capital food of the philippines) and try some of the food there specially our famous sisig!..
"Sisig! Street food - isaw, betamax, one day old, balut"

"Eat Sisig, Chicken Inasal, any grilled fresh seafood that you bought from the local market, Sinigang, Crispy Pata, Pinakbet,  Lechon (Cebu), etc. Go to Mercato, Dampa, and Binondo for a food trip. All these within Metro Manila. A lot more to explore."

Try to eat Balot and isaw or a chicken intestine thats a challenge whenever ur here in Phil
How about... Try Eat Balut???! Nice vid..
I believe ampalaya is called bitter gourd not bitter melon.
Try isaw and betamax and other street food here! Bellychon or lechon is also a must to try in Cebu!
"i want you to try!  isaw, dugo, tenga, bituka, kwek kwek, balut haja"
"Mango, lechon"
"eat sisig, balut, pork sinigang and mango float"
"For a classy filipino food here in Manila try to eat in Abe, Sarsa,Kamayan, Kuya J, Barrio Fiesta, Gloria Maries and many more"
"For more food ideas, view the  MaputingCooking vlog of Aussie chef Chris Urbano. Balut isn&#39;t the only street food to try. Try Siopao and Mami in Masuki (SM Megamall Building B Lower Ground) or its original branch in Binondo Chinatown. Look for Pancit Lomi from Batangas and Pancit Molo and Lapaz Batchoy from Iloilo. Lechon Kawali and Lechon Paksiw are two different treatments of the whole Lechon. For vegetarian fare, try Lumpia Togue, Fresh Lumpia, Pinakbet, and Malunggay (Moringa) leaves in Munggo Bean porridge. For dessert, tropical fruit salad and buko pandan are good."
Go to philippines and eat ! Because in ph more different spices than in your area !
It&#39;s like the Philippines but people are with umbrellas because the sun is so hot hahaha
Try Bicol express . Philippines
"Try to eat ambers golden chain palabok, lumpia and pichi pichi with cheese... super yummy you won&#39;t regret it!!! It&#39;s the bomb!"
Life in the U.S is so hard.. finding foods to eat will take a lot of time.. need a car...

"If you go to the Philippines, try to meet Kulas of BecommingFilipino (Kyle Jennermann) he surely knows so many good places there, and if you want food tripping look for The Hungry Syrian Wanderer you can find them here on YouTube. Cheers!"
Bitter melon is underrated.. Filipino oldies likes it especially those health conscious its a must to eat it.(.But kids hate it)..Bitter melon is food for the liver..
I don&#39;t see that ice cream sandwich in our Seafood City here in NorCal. Looks good. Seems like a fancy version of the ice cream sandwich sold as a street food in the Philippines.
"go to cebu for the lechon, manila for the street foods, bohol for the sea food, ilocos for the longganisa, empanada, and bagnet. sagada for the etag pampanga for the sisig. hmm best to spend a month or two to try diff foods from diff islands here"

Aren&#39;t you the lead singer for that band Offspring?
Eat Insal Chicken and Balut =D
Why that adobo seems watery or oily?
"Shawn, I&#39;ve been waiting for your vlog. I thought u were going to spend Christmas and New Year in Boracay. Nice to see u back. Safe travels and enjoy my motherland. Do not miss going to Cloud 9 in Siargao!"
"Have you tried halo-halo?  This is a nice desert. But generally if I‚Äôm honest Philippino food is my least favorite out of Asian one, though adobo is nice:)"
"Lol dude! Can&#39;t believe you ate all these in one seating!!! How did your tongue (and stomach) take it? Do you have like a reset button for each time you switch to another food? Either that or you were really starving before doing this vid... Hands up man, hands up! I&#39;m a new follower so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re ever been to the different places in the Philippines to get the genuine experience coming from where these variety of food originally came. I strongly suggest you do if you haven&#39;t done so yet :)"

"i don&#39;t see anything wrong with your comments man. they&#39;re constructive. destructive and disrespectful comments on your show usually come from people who do not genuinely know how to cook or appreciate food. these are the people who only show up by the time the food is already served, or are probably fast food junkies not worth your attention sir. you are one of the culinary specialists  who have embraced filipino food culture genuinely and unpretentious enough to tell us the bad side of filipino culinary arts. thank you. your haters are the type of people who do not even know how to boil water, or would over-fry an egg or hotdog. never mind them. just keep on making your constructive comments. good filipinos are all ears."
Honestly jollihotdog is my only fav food with jollibee. Jollihotdog with chocolate sundae üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ yummy
üò±üò±üò± thanks Chris!
Keep it up Chris üòÅü§£ü§£
"I felt like the quality of some of their food like the burger is better in the U.S.<br>Malake pa yung servings,dito maliliit pang bata yung servings, tapos yung luto is so inconsistent,like the fries minsan pag order mo malamig na or sometimes overcooked ,sometimes salty sometimes not but yeah depends on the branch where you purchased it....üôÑ"
Thanks for posting this video!  I can‚Äôt comment on the Jollibee dishes anymore since I practice VEGAN healthy living.
Chocolate Zhang is bitter.. hahaha can&#39;t accept the feedback seems he grow up in old civilization..thanks for the review Cris..
Jolibee doesnt even regularize their employees lol. 6months and your gone and the amount of hardwork they do doesnt even justify the crap salary they get.
"Chris...Just ignore those immature minds. I&#39;m a Filipino and I never like everything Jollibee is offering. I never liked Jollibee Chickenjoy ever since because they don&#39;t do the best fried chicken. For me, McDonald&#39;s make the second best fried chicken in the Philippines next to KFC. However, Sunburst is the best healthy fried chicken and the most value for money as they don&#39;t put loads of breader and batter on their chicken, just pure chicken meat. At least here in Cebu we have options for less greasy fried chicken and I&#39;m quite glad we have Sunburst here.:-)"
Most of time I would take out McDo fries then get a Jollibee Chicken joy then eat them all at Burger King with their grilled burger and Apple juice.
Plain and simple....I love your videos! Some Filipinos are so dramatic...keep on keeping on!
i do agree with the reaction regarding the strawberry fries because I tried it after watching your review and it is as you said Terrible
Jollibee the business magaling sila. Pero jollibee the food SUCKS. Masa kasi ang market eh
I love it that you are authentic. we all need a slap on the face from time to time. what i mean is let us be open to the need for changes with something that we&#39;ve been so used to. Room for improvement I say!
"hey chris, since this vid why not look for the mcdonalds schezuan sauce? Ph were the very first to get it, I think even from china."
"I went to Jollibee just to taste their strawberry fries because I got so curious what it taste like after watching your review, to be honest it doesn&#39;t taste bad but it doesn&#39;t taste great either. In a weird way, it kinda work I guess coz it taste like sweet version of sour cream flavor with a hint of artificial strawberry smell. I will never order it again tho.hehe"
Love the way your unbiased reviews man

"I actually love Gordon Ramsey!üòÅüòÅüòÅ The only reason why he&#39;s shown as an *hole is nothing more than for USA tv drama (he&#39;s more laid-back and happy in the UK shows he stars in). And seriously with some of the people he works with I&#39;d probably be worse than him at swearing üòÇüòÇüòÇ.  But mad respect for him. He started with nothing, a broken family, a brother who got into drugs and actually tried to convince him to do drugs as well. And instead of ruining his life he turned down his brother&#39;s offer and decided to work at a small diner at the age of 19. Learned the skills that got him where he is now. He&#39;s also an awesome/weird dad üòÇüòÇüòÇ. I&#39;m not criticizing Chris, I&#39;m just saying... If you can&#39;t tell I&#39;m a big Gordon fanüòÇüòÇüòÇ awesome vid as always!üòäüòäüòä"
make a review of burger king!!üòÑ
"I really like your unbiased reviews on Jolibee...I do love Jolibee esp their Jolly hotdogs and fries...but sometimes like the way you have observed (the number of mushroom on the burgersteak) made me realize that they&#39;ve overlooked these things. Of course Jolibee is the country&#39;s most known and respected fast food chain. If they want to keep that reputation, they should improve better standards for their food. So I think it&#39;s just fair and square that you shared this review with us. Keep it up Sir Chris:) don&#39;t worry about the bashers around, I do enjoy your videos everytime. More power and God bless you. ;)"
"Good on you Chris, you‚Äôre a legend"
"Filipino eating habits is terribly unhealthy, they consume too much added sugar. Would love to see educational vids about what happens when excessive sugar, salt or fat is introduced to the body. To the contrary with hater comments, Chris is respectful and fair with his reviews and I consider him more Filo than most of us! It would do much for the health and well being of subscribers (and haters) to follow his advice and recommendations. There&#39;s too much sponsorship on YT these days, it&#39;s rare to see an unbiased review of big fast food chains like JB - they&#39;re spaghetti is waaay to sweet!! Keep up your channel&#39;s great philosophy, Chris. By the way, what on earth is mukbang?"
Wow!! Great to hear your response to some comments. The naughty and the nice... I wish I could give  you a million likes but I am not a programmer so I will give you üëçand ‚ù§. üëå
"Hello Chris... this comment has nothing to do with Jollibee, but about YOU. I&#39;ve seen most of your videos by now and I have to make this comment. There are times when you speak english that you speak it with your Australian accent. But there are times, specially lately, that you have seemed to have adopted, I&#39;m sure organically, an accent that sounds very much like how a native Filipino speaks English. In short, you&#39;re starting to sound like how a Filipino speaks English. And it&#39;s actually amazing. :D"
"I‚Äôm Filipino, my mom was born in Manila, I love traditional Filipino food. I tried most things on Jollibee‚Äôs menu and I would feel guilting feeding that slop to my dog. I follow you for your honesty, keep it up!"

"Except for the Dried Mangoes, most of what you got are the cheap ones. They used cheap ingredients or lessened ingredients for budgetary reasons. The polvoron and chocnut should have been left at the refrigirator for at east 2 hours. Its better to eat it hard, but sometimes we play , e.g say &quot;My name is mike&quot; while eating polvoron without spitting it.  The mystery snack is also a polvoron but covered with chocolate. The boy bawang, chippy are beer mates. People in the Philippines who cant afford the better brands or american snacks go for those snacks you got. Also, the total cost of all the products in that box is only $5. Boy Bawang is pronounce Boy Ba - Wang not Weng, like ba ba black sheep and like Wang as in chinese last name."
everything &#39;bout the filipins is &quot;adventure&quot; üå¥üåäüå≥üèÑüçÉ including the food (*snacks)
"Great video. For ube cake, we rarely buy the ones in the pack though. We either buy from an actual bakery or make it ourselves. And it&#39;s very moist, unlike the packaged version ;) maybe drop by a Goldilocks or Red Ribbon if you have one in your area :) you will find Filipino pastries there :)"
your editing is so gooddddd
YOU GUYS ARE SO PRETTY !!!!!
Wow nice breakfast
You managed to open it! Haha ;)
Looks like you‚Äôre having a lot of fun on your travels! I know you were nervous at first but it looks like it‚Äôs been worth it!

"Hope Jollibee knows how to take care crews. They always have charity work before, meaning overtime without pay."
Jollibee became successful in spreading love and Filipino Foodchain industry and worldwide.  Jollibee is very cute.
please make a branch here in taiwan...!!!

Katabi lng ng jollibee ang mcdo haha
Wow nice
Sana may jolibee branch dn kayo  sa taiwan po
Sana magbukas kyo dto sa lebanon.nakakasawa na ang kfc.

So beautiful place  love it
And I thought Vegans and Vegetarians are aware of endangered species.<br>The video title is misleading and yes I get the sarcastic jokes.
Did you see any cage? None because the tarsiers go out to hunt in the evenings. The tarsiers are nocturnal animals.
"Sad to say, but this is just awful..."
Making a tour in Bohol without a tour guide is only 50% experienced. Bohol is so rich in culture and history and of course the nature. Guys do check out this online: <br>Philippine Tarsier Sanctuary In Corella to know more about tarsier and Bohol&#39;s effort on preserving them. Better yet do visit the Bohol Tourism Office for info before doing your countryside tours in Bohol.
What do you mean not worth it?
You should have come to Dumaluan Beach in Panglao Bohol..its cleaner and longer white sandy beach..there you will not see star fish ..boats ..it is really beautiful paradise.  Most tourist dont know Dumaluan..that&#39;s why they regret at the end now come back and go thereüñêÔ∏èüòÉ
I respect ur opinion Sir. üëå nice vid üáµüá≠
I live there for 10 years and due to tourist ruining Bohol as well as other places in Phil i come back to Tennessee
"Actually,  chocolate hills is having a problem with trees.  Trees and weeds invaded/ &#39;infested&#39;  the hills disrupting the hills beauty.  Around 50% of the hills are infested and awaiting for the President&#39;s approval to be cut. Its called chocolate hills for it turns brown on summer.  <br><br><a href=""http://www.boholchronicle.com.ph/2018/01/12/presidents-approval-awaited-for-tree-cutting-in-chocolate-hills/"">http://www.boholchronicle.com.ph/2018/01/12/presidents-approval-awaited-for-tree-cutting-in-chocolate-hills/</a>"
"Hahaha. I always hear that legend about two Giants fighting. And, about Tarsier, they need a quiet place because they might die if it is noisy. Hope you&#39;re having fun!!!!!!!!!!"
lol thinking Bohol is a zoo even though u haven&#39;t learn about stuffs there :D Just judging a special places
So sad.. they don&#39;t like it üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Yeah!!!! You are VERY SARCASTIC!!!
Kinda ‚Äò degrading the area you are VLOGGING!!!!why u went there???!!!
I think you misunderstood the purpose of their sanctuary for Tarsier. It is one of the ways to get funds to continuously support their habitat and the survival of their specie.
Ignorant vloggers. Do some research first!
Eww bohol bashers
*zoo *crazy *lazy
*not
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr just shut up ur mouths crazy and lazy noobs and peoples chocolate hills is going to be chocolate if that&#39;s summer but if rainy days it will be grassland and what the mmmm u just know what I&#39;m saying BTW forget about it why u say LITTLE BIT!??!!??!

Your title is misleading. You clearly want to attract more viewers on your video. Clickbaiting much?? Smfh!
I love how you guys enjoy the simple things in life life. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed your stay here in the Philippines ‚ò∫
Just watched this...bad info and title but still a good video...maybe Asians just cant keep up with European sarcasm so better lessen em üòÅ
"Why not worth it, Bohol island?"
Nice collab been following tall.
peenoise being noisy again :/<br>bash me im pinoy too
Shame on you all. you seem to have no respect.
love your vlogs always cool
Thank you guys next year we are going to the Phil. To see this place .

My mom is from Bohol and my uncle had a wife from Cebu üòä
"Mmmmm! I miss authetic Filipino food, like that."
"When tarsiers are stressed, they just hold their breath then die :("
idiots... french....
"Another FUNtastic vlog guys, thumbs up 10X,"
"Try to visit North Luzon especially Cagayan Valley, it is where Palaui Island(2 Seasons of Survivor America taped) is located, they call it the Boracay of the North. There&#39;s a lot of beaches overvthere. And if you love spelunking you can visit Callao Cave. And if you love food, you must try the famous Batil Patong(Pancit) of Tuguegarao City.<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/zghMfNUQWKE"">https://youtu.be/zghMfNUQWKE</a>"
Its not worth it but I heared that there was a historical History about it
All I can say is do more research on the places you go to or ask the guides and know the facts before you say somethin. And next time try not to misslead your viewers with the title cause its quite offensive for others...
the one u ate? in karinderia?  filipino Food 100% authentic
Wow what nice place.
"Wish you guys had a nice visit there,,P.s. Don&#39;t mind your Basher"
This video promote a negative impression of what the sanctuary is all about. It‚Äôs not a zoo people!!!
I got suprised that Tal is in this video! Subscribed already!üëç
So loud...
The people who dislikes are your bashers now because of the title u put in there brother hahahaüòÅüòÅ
may kakupetensya na pala si &quot;Kulas Becoming A Filipino&quot;  hehehe

Nice collab!
"You made a few mistakes there.  The tarsier conservation area in Corella is not a zoo.  The area where tourists can go around is like a few hundred square metres of about 20 has behind the little area.  The tarsiers are territorial, nocturnal and they come back to their &quot;base&quot;.  You can&#39;t just go into the jungle and see them, because they  are protected unless you&#39;re national geographic itself on a serious study.  The zoo part is due to the number of tourists wanting to see them.  Including people like you and me.<br><br>The chocolate hills are green in the rainy season and brown in the dry season, not because of deforestation or soil exploitation.  The hills are limestone and have very little top soil.  The whole of Bohol island, Panglao etc are limestone, very hard to grow deep rooting trees.<br><br>I learned that by reading the markers, info boards and listening to the guides."
c&#39;est vraiment tr√®s beau
Another Logan Paul in the making. You idiot
liked and subscribed
"If u dont like,well thats ur opinion, be careful about the words u say it, coz we filipinos are very sensitive specialy the issue about my country. You can say it in a nice way. We know that  all d tourist visiting in d philippines are not happy and satisfied.but i want you to know that we are very friendly, hospitable &amp; happy people. Thats all, peace to everybody."
Enjoy :)
Do Some Research First about the Chocolate Hills before saying anything you really Don&#39;t know....it changes color from green to brown...depends in the season
"BTW, Tarsiers in the Philippines are endemic in Bohol but research show that when the Visayas and Mindanao were still heavily forested, they also existed there. Tarsiers can also be found in the wilderness of Indonesia, Borneo and Papua New Guinea so it&#39;s a mistake to say that it can only be found in the Philippines."
Finding the chocolate hills u cant find the brown color if its rainy season
"Im  a bit concernee about tarsier they supposed to be sleep and <a href=""http://relax.at/"">relax.at</a> morning coz they nocturnal and active feeding at night silence must be imposed at all times they might get stressed!"
"Good NYC accent from a French  (juste un peu l&#39;intonation qui trahit qques fois ;) Right and funny the girl looks like a Filipina with LA accent . Les phips disent que les Philippines c le seul endroit au monde pour les tarsiers.<br>J&#39;en ai vu disons plus dans leurs jus √† manado Indonesie. Un secret en valant un autre, √† charge de revanche en retour pour quelques conseils peut √™tre pour Siargao que j&#39;ai visite trop rapidement."
It is green because the grass on the hills is still fresh.
u guys do research first before u complain.
That title tho feels like you want some bashers haha
"If you truly enjoyed your tour of the Chocolate Hills, then your title of this video &quot;Don&#39;t Visit This on Bohol Island - Not Worth It&quot; is misleading...unless, if you deliberately tried to mislead your subscribers to gain more clicks. This is an old trick (reverse psychology) which usually backfires, and then you get more dislikes, or worse, people will hate your blogs and unsubscribe. ¬†Some bloggers are full of it."
It&#39;s not a zoo though. It&#39;s basically their nest. Ahaha. It is the smallest monkey I think?
Clatts represent!
I knew this vid&#39;s gonna get dislikes just by how the title goes. My fellow Filipinos are really that funny sometimes. Lol. Seems like reverse psychology don&#39;t work that well on some Filipinos. :D
What&#39;s the name of the shotgun microphone your bearded friend uses?
"If you complain AFTER going there, WHY go there in the first place? Seeing the tarsiers is not a secret. It&#39;s all over the internet. It&#39;s not like &quot;oh gee, i didn&#39;t know they do it like this..&quot;"
"Tal and Pierre combined, hahaha. I created a monster !!"
The chocolate hills called chocolate because of its perfect cone like figure....and the color like choco in dry season
"in china, they have the panda breeding program to reverse the Extinction of the panda and a massive research and sanctuary for the animal."
Those drone shots look absolutely great! Nice job on the color grading!
Nice nice üëçüèºtotally agree tarsiers belong to the forest. Can‚Äôt wait next vid swimming with the turtles! üòÑ
Do you know the meaning of zoo in the first place?
You guys are hilarious. I love it &lt;3

"LOL chocolate hills are covered with mostly grass and some trees! It&#39;s hard to deforest a grass guys. the hills turn brown during the dry season especially in summer. if its rainy season, they are mostly green"
"Could I say, it&#39;s not chocolate anymore because it is practically planted new trees?!?!.. so I can call it now.. flavored chocolate hills..it is now.. MINT GREEN CHOCOLATE HILLS!?............hehehehe!! joke!! Kidding aside.. it shows the color brown/chocolate when the sun is start to rise up. You must be there before dawn. It shows its color early in the morning, not at noon or afternoon. By the way,.....Anything in this world shows the beauty in the morning..."
Looks like a cool place!
Another great video blog!
"it&#39;s not a zoo. it&#39;s a sanctuary for Tarsiers. otherwise you would see elephants and giraffes etc.. and the hills are not deforested... they&#39;re naturally mostly devoid of trees, except for grasses. <br><br> what&#39;s with the video title?, quite misleading... you seemed pretty satisfied on the chocolate hills..."

"And about that particular place, yeah, you got the wrong one, better research and ask more where the best places are and remember to read the comments first b4 you go, that I think is best."
"Chocolate Hills have never been forested. LOL. They&#39;re karst (limestone) formations, the same process that made those rocks in El Nido, except more deeply eroded. Trees have a hard time growing on them because the soil layer is quite shallow. They&#39;re normally covered by cogon grass. They turn green because it&#39;s the wet season. They&#39;re brown in the summer. The tarsier sanctuaries are also more like breeding centers. There are wild ones but they are endangered because of habitat fragmentation. Forests still exist of course, but they are often bisected or isolated by roads towns, etc."
Tarsiers want silence they go wild or even commits suicide if they&#39;re disturbed.
Nice to see you together in the vlog. I wish they could do to the tarsiers what china is doing to the panda.
Drone shot one of the best.
"Tarsiers hates tourists. Especially, French tourists."
ohh.. didn&#39;t expect Tal. hehe.
"@PierreTL...You should climb Osmena Peak, the highest point in Cebu. From the peak, you&#39;d see hundreds of jagged peaks around you like you have never seen anything like them before. If Chocolate Hills are mounds or rounded tops, the Mantalongon mountain range is strewn with jagged or pointed peaks that stretch as far as your eyes can see, the view is surreal or out-of-this-world scenery. Osmena Peak is a very easy climb, a mere 1.3 kilometer scenic trek from the registration area. Most tourists climb there either early in the morning for the sunrise or late afternoon for the sunset. Many people even camp overnight and trek to Kawasan Falls early the next day."
Hey you guys went to the wrong &#39;conservation center&#39;. The one in this video is the one in Loboc right? They are a non-official tarsier sanctuary and more of a business. I was warned about it when I visited Bohol a few years ago. A better alternative would&#39;ve been the Tarsier Research and Development Center in Corella which is the official one. It was much more quiet and you could only see the animals with a guide. I haven&#39;t been to the one in Loboc but from your video I could clearly see a difference compared to the one in Corella.
We have also a myth about those chocolate hills... It was said that those hills was came from a womans tears that was deeply hurt because her loved one dies.
"Sweet banana lady. The sanctuary protects the Tarsiers to breed. Syndicates hunt them in the wild, and sell on the black market."
Great video guys!
1st! Agree with you about the Tarsiers. I was able to visit them when I was a little kid in the 90s. Less tourists and a more natural habitat. Met Tal the day before Xmas here in Cebu. Great vid guys!
"In my case, I knew I didn&#39;t need a degree for an entertainment career. EVERYONE SAW ME AS A LOST CASE. I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t waste my time studying something I didn&#39;t care about for 3 or 4 yrs, and now EVERYONE understands! Great video, David! Tell it how it is!"
"The sad thing is that nowadays, even if one can be really skilled, more and more hiring agencies only consider those with Bachelors at least; and if you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll get discarded over someone with a Master. And I do not mean job were a degree is obviously required (Law, Medicine, Psychology, etc...), but nowadays even being a Designer, Artist, Engineer, Journalist or anything of that sort will give you closed doors without the paper. For instance, I am Italian, I am just going to start my Uni. degree in Industrial Design because I don&#39;t have any developed skillset by the moment I finished highschool. I am fully aware that I could learn all those drawing software like AutoCAD and Maya through online videos and practice, however I feel like without the given Uni. environment it would be impossible to achieve differently. I am personally counting all I have in my life on this 5-year effort in my life (Bachelor + Master Deg.) because I hope to develop some skills through my teachers, efforts and good environment. The only lucky thing is that tuition here is extremely cheap and I wouldn&#39;t experience debt or similar."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo3As36trkA&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a> agree thats the reason why I take my fathers word to heart even now after I garduate recently especially becuase my course is BSAMT someone who is mechanic of a aircraft, &quot;Learning and studying does not stop not even after you graduate&quot;, why? The world is changing around you at a fast rate and you can&#39;t stop it you may not know it but you are unconsiusly learning and studying to adopt all the time everyday. Those who did not attend or skip or simply drop out of college that also strongly applies to you guys becuase your skills and passion is whats ganna help you to succeed remember life does not discriminate grad or not. Goodluck."
My father is already 51 and has a college degree and used to work at a government office SSS and Deped but my father lost his job during 2017 and it took 4 years to get him back to work but as a factory worker the worst part the salary is very small.
"college and marriages are some of the things  that society has instilled in us, but they aren&#39;t for everyone.  There isn&#39;t just one blueprint for living the perfect life, so don&#39;t feel obligated by societal pressures."
"This is accurate in the Philippines, I just want to learn animation but the problem is that there are so many subjects that aren&#39;t really related to our talented field and the parents are expecting their child to graduate from college and gaining a diploma so that they can be instantly successful but in reality you won&#39;t be able to due to the economy in this country."
"This is an eye-opener for us filipinos, very informative videoüëèüíØ"
"Though the country needs more reporters,i still want a animation degree even or the computers programming degree..."
The only people who can afford to not go to college are people who can actually afford  to go to college. Your screwed if you have no background. &quot;Oh just self learn&quot; SELF LEARN WITH WHAT? Books and internet needs money and nowadays jobs barely give you that spare change.
"My dad who studied in college: You fool, you can&#39;t catch me now."
"Meaning of life? decide what you want do not let this so called &quot;DESTINY&quot; control you nor your happiness. What is best for you is to not follow the tasks of God which is finish college. God&#39;s plan and your plan is different, if you think your plan is better than his. Go for it, if not let him control you; your life will be miserable afterwards."
"thank you for this video <br>and i learn something that<br>going to college is not a waste of time or a waste of money.<br> just put them together <br>degree plus skill  , do what you want have business etc... <br>make sure you will not regret everthing and be happy ."
Why shouldn&#39;t go to college.. We filipino we dont have ah degree.. But we filipino ha ah skill.. What ever we work.. We filipino we adopt the work ar the person who we speak for. Do you get it

"I don&#39;t know about the Philippines, but in the United States colleges and universities are mega expensive and are now getting even a lot more expensive in recent years (second most expensive to health care costs in the United States).  Unless you have very rich parents who have more than enough money and who are willing to pay your full tuition and fees, chances are you have to get loans and incur a massive debt to get through college (some people are still paying off student loans even past retirement age).  Not to mention, many universities require first (and some second) year students to live on campus and buy a meal plan, which drives the cost up ten-fold.  Plus, many college degrees, are really not worth as much as the sheet of paper it is printed on.  Plus, many college graduates wind up not getting a job in the same field in which they went to college for and what their degree is in."
"but the problem is in the philippines you need that piece of paper called the transcript of records to get you a job and earn money. dont go to college unless your like this guy who have dollars ang convert it to other currencies at higher exchange rate. sure you dont get the skill you need in college. you only get the skills at the workplace. why dont follow this steps. 1. invest in yourself(go to college,learn from  others, watch educational videos,read a lot, learn financial literacy and money management skills) 2. get a job, earn money, invest the money and plan your future ahead."
EH UH SIS- EVERYONE SHOULD NOT GO TO COLLEGE
High school is a necessity <br>College is a choice<br>-Kanye<br>Don&#39;t rush your decisions take your time making the best choice for yourself
"i want to cure people from diseases, if i dont go to college id just be a quack and an alternative no  therapeutic proof sarsa parilla, snake oil seller.."
idk how my cousins got to college.....
"I didn&#39;t go to college to study Agricultural Engineering, I only went to TESDA to study the specific knowledge and skills I needed about Agriculture. Now I own a Farm School and earn an average of 3 million pesos a month."
It&#39;s a money buster
"What I hate about getting a degree in the Philippines is that having a PRC license that you worked hard for does not make any difference and you just end up getting minimum wage same as other people. The best degree to get in the country would be in the business industry. Our country is best for business but never for employees. Healthcare degrees is the worst, don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s nice to help out other people but not at the expense that you use years of your life for it. &quot;Overworked yet underpaid&quot; this is what our country consider as some sort of altruism or something that other people looked up too. This is also the very reason why nobody changes the system. A lot of people complain how high medical bills are but most employee who works at a private hospitals only gets a bit of a salary. I kind of hate the reality of hospital business owners, they would get a lot of patients to be served but would only hire a few staffs to do the work. You get to work 12-24 hours in a day, with working lunch, in around 6-7x a week, in a salary that would probably pay the bills but then are we just born to pay those bills? Isn&#39;t it ironic how most medical professionals are also the same people who doesn&#39;t have the time to exercise or eat right not because they don&#39;t want to but simply because they don&#39;t actually have the time for them. How do you even spend time with your family with those kind of hours or do some household chores? This is the very reason why all our medical professional go to other countries, it is just not really worth it to stay unless someone gets brave enough to change the kind of healthcare system that we have. As long as your employer is in the Philippines you wouldn&#39;t get a salary that you can enjoy your life, I have a whole of friends working on BPOs even before they had their degrees and they have far by better salary even just working from their homes than getting too overworked and underpaid working in hospitals."

Ok you know what david you are my mindset hahaha.
I was already a liability in my first semester in University of Baguio today. I plan on transferring to state college next semester. But my parents just don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m struggling and just wasting money. &quot;Work international&quot; I don&#39;t want that because it&#39;s not the one I want.

"I was an achiever since grade school just because my parents and relatives told me that when u&#39;re good at school, u will be great in life.<br>Now I&#39;m in college and man...I don&#39;t know who I am. I was blinded by their plans for me. It feels like I&#39;m living their dreams and using me to create their dream life. Still don&#39;t know how to tell my parents that I&#39;m not happy anymore and I can&#39;t take the pressure. I love them so much but it feels like I&#39;m not being free to decide for myself. It&#39;s really hard esp. when u&#39;re the eldest and they would expect you to take care of them and u have the responsibility to create life for your siblings. But what about me? I want a life tooüíî"

"Skills over Degree, But in Philippines They Prefer Degree over Skills."
Some others are Good in education<br>Some others are Good in L I F E
"A degree is between experience and profession loss, we still have jobless professionals and professionals who chooses not to work on their profession for a reason that jobs aren&#39;t always available.<br>Experience, majority of the companies chooses experienced workers than fresh or college graduates."
Yes that&#39;s so true but skipping college takes courage which is not everyone will be able to handle. In the end most of us will just take college because of pressure and uncertainty
&quot;TECHVOC vs. ACADEMIC&quot;
That was accurate other&#39;s are get a job for their family and hardship because they have no money to pay college fees or other&#39;s they have a job to pay college fees for their families
That is not true
If no college = hard to get a job<br>If college = rich boi

Then you should have said &quot;Why you shouldnt go to College&quot;. Otherwise you sound like a white guy telling brown people what to do
Maraming salamat po
Your case is different than our. There are more opportunities for people who went to college. How can you encourage people not to learn something that could help them be somebody?  Very few got lucky without any degrees. Your life is different than others. Not everyone wants to be in showbiz.  This is stupid.
Me wanting to get a phd to be a scientist<br>Well No way<br>But respect to the people who wont go to college to pursue what they actually want
Most people will argue with this because it is much easier to go to college and do some stupid job afterwards than actually doing something that makes themselves better.
Did not go to college and built my own business from scratch.
"&quot;Kung Pilipino ang nagbabasa nito, Kababayan, &#39;wag kang maniwala sa pinag-sasabi ng dayuhang ito. Hindi n&#39;ya dinanas ang pagdudusa&#39;t hirap na naranasan mo. Kailangan mong magpursiging makapagtapos upang walang aapi sa&#39;yo. Dahil ang sinsambit niya&#39;y mula sa sariling karanasan, at hindi karanasang iyo.&quot;<br><br>Schools are businesses. Moreover, education is essential to the underprivileged. Your opinion does not count if you were born with a silverspoon in your mouth. You came from a developed country; your experience does not correlate here in the Philippines. <br>Having the skills is definitely the golden ticket for whatever you want to address; however, higher education here is as quintessential as having shelter. It opens opportunities for families who are unable to provide 3-square meals a day. It&#39;s their hope out of poverty. <br>You speak as if you have experienced the way they do. Don&#39;t share your &quot;ideas&quot; to the people alone‚Äî it&#39;s not how it works here if you don&#39;t have influence or power; instead, go ahead and petition to the government and change their mindset, I urge you."
"I&#39;m a Filipino and, even though my friends and I are all 13, we are looking forward to our college. The degree, I agree but I guess you can get in with a scholarship.

Thank you!!
"Real truth, if you didn‚Äôt finish college, a lot of people have crab mentality and they will judge you in the Philippines. They think you are dumb, no future, etc. Degree is just a piece of document, it‚Äôs a thing that you‚Äôve hardworked on but it doesn‚Äôt guarantee that it will make you successful."
Here in Philippines mostly when you apply they will ask you if you have college diploma they have this requirements especially ifnyou work in a company... And about you said their are really skills that doesnt need to go to college because the skills itself only needs practice and more experience or somebody could  teach you on the spot for example my dad he did not went to college.. and when he came to Manila he tried to apply in a famous company that in making jeepneys at that time he doesnt have experienced in welding.. so he started as helper then eventually he was thought there in the company in how to wellding and he learned from it and works abroad too so his experience trained him to be better wellder... I believe each of us has its own gifted skills and talent and we must discover it early at our age... Anyways here in Philippines there are vocational courses that you need to go to study for 3 months to learn some basic knowledge.. and these are skilled job like aircon technician beautician and a lot more and they do study the basic and they became better and better as they work and haveore experienced in a particular skills...each of us has its own gift of skills each of us have its own calling you are lucky if you discover your capability at the early age...amd for me theres nothing wrong if you want to go to college or you dont go to college because your can learn your skills by experienced. Each company has its own requirement all over the world some company requires college diploma and some company will not require you aslong as you have the skills and you can do it. So it means still it depends. Each of us has its own path and distination. Discovering your skills is the key in here the earlier the better so you will know if its need to go to college or not.
Super Agree. Kaya lang Filipino take so much pride sa degree nila kahit hindi naman ginagamit. Pangyabang lang.
Filipinos should only go to college if they have an ambition to earn a degree.
Practical &gt; Academic
"i&#39;ve graduated a 4 year degree in teaching. üòÇ and also i&#39;ve became unemployed for 3 years. that&#39;s why a degree is somehow obsolete nowadays. i&#39;ve attended a short course in computer course and after the hardwork i am currently a data scientist. üòä guys, all you need is experience and skills to find your dream job."
are you dumb stupid or dumb your not the goverment
"i regret attending college bc i dont like it. and ofcourse, the mentality and high expectations that makes me unemployed for this reason. College is just an adult version of high school. good thing i graduated with a degree in food and service management and ended up in a catering services full of homophobics and unbearable co-employees because i  was an outcast, even in college. but positively, college taught me how to be an independent  and how to prevent procrastinations. also, how to get away with nonsense. soon, i&#39;ll  find a job the makes me comfortable and easy to bear with. thanks for the video."
My dad is a filipino and he said to me he go to college in philippines
"Tbh I hate college... one reason is alot of the subjects and some topics/activities are irrelevant to the course.<br><br>I was a dean&#39;s lister back then though, but I experienced severe depression, insomnia, and anxiety everyday.<br>I also became more suicidal and prone to self-inflicted injury.<br><br>I didn&#39;t learned much that I have to take multiple short-courses and trainings after I graduated."
i wanna show this to my parents.
"This is true! I&#39;m a student, I have learned some of my high income skills from successful people and the Internet. &quot;Competition&quot; yan ang tinuturo sa school not skills na makakatulong sa totoong buhay."
"I‚Äôm sorry , I get what you‚Äôre saying but just because things worked out for you by not going to college , does not mean that applies for everyone , I know people who graduated  from college and universities and they are doing well for themselves .This idea where you think everyone should follow your steps cuz they worked wonders for you is wrong. I agree that sometimes colleges and institutions can be a struggle, confusing and expensive but not all colleges are hopeless and some are worth the struggle. Please stop with the ‚Äú I know better attitude ‚Äú  and stick to singing !"
Simple answer: <b>CAUSE THEY&#39;RE POOR</b>
I ALWAYS HATE BEING A FILIPINO
"I don&#39;t get why there&#39;s people who unlike this video, they probably didn&#39;t watch or understand it. This is so true and very well said üíñ"
Employers generally require a college degree just to whittle down the sheer amount of applicants for a job and to make the hiring process easier. It&#39;s called gatekeeping.
"<b>‚ÄúStudy hard and graduate and you will become successful in life.‚Äù Filipino‚Äôs logic, a cultural habit.‚Äù Money is not taught in school. School focuses on learning new things and of course, skills, professional skills, but not on money skills. Students leave college without financial skills, we, the educated people then pursue our profession or whatever job we got coz nowadays even in the UK, it‚Äôs all about the degree AND Personality. At the end, why do we find ourselves struggling financially? They don‚Äôt teach us how to manage money. That‚Äôs all you need to know and you can become your own boss one day if you know how to save, invest and later on set up your own business. No need to go to college. Hope I knew that, now my Student loan from the UK kept bugging me like I‚Äôm lying that I just started working in Japan after a year.</b>"
While our parents forcing us to college of  the profession you don&#39;t like. If you don&#39;t follow what they said you don&#39;t get their support.
I seriously find it offensive to see a white person tell us what what to do
"Dude are u for real? A degree is not for academic or a diploma is not just a peice of paper. Its more than that, you can say all thiz things since you were born in a different country and had the most in life, unlike us. Well its true that many people not just in the philippines but all over the world, have a college degree. I respect your own opinion, but this video is not helping."
And WOAH on comparing The Great Depression to the Philippines&#39; curent state (at the time of the video)
"I think this was badly researched. The occupations you mentioned in the video don&#39;t really pay much in the Philippines. Also, you shouldn&#39;t have targeted Filipinos in the video just because you don&#39;t know enough about how things work here. Your suggestions might work in the USA, but not here. I may be wrong but the reason you&#39;re saying this is for FILIPINOS is because you know you&#39;re gonna reach a larger audience since wr&#39;re the social media capital of the world."
Filipino&#39;s will turn where they are into where they are from by having CHILDREN.
"Then Why,"
Somehow i agree on this video.. I&#39;m a Electronics Engineer in a Semiconductor company before. And now doing a business which i love more...
"Actually, k-12 helps you to be relevant in order to get a good job in the future...also it helps you to be part of any jobs you want once you are started in k-12. For example, without k-12 in the Philippines you are a doctor but in the other country you just a nurse or a caregiver. How lower is that to be and that suck at all."
"I respect the decisions for those who want to go to college but please dont treat the college as an investment, never borrow a money for an expensive universities. It is the worst decision most Filipino people make that leave them broke."
"I am glad you did the disclosure about MEDICAL SCIENCES. Before I got my nursing degree, I was a waiter, flower designer to get my nursing degree. Now because of my nursing degree, I am now an American citizen and retiring soon."
"I dont know why a lot gets butthurt, but somehow he is right. I skipped college and decided to learn programming by myself (it was May 2018). This video is the one that encouraged me to not go to college. At first I was very skeptical about my decision, but I just did it because its already too late to regret. Thank God, now I am earning some money and learning more than my colleagues. (Of course, not everyone should dropout/skip college. The idea is you can improve your skills more and utilize them effectively without going to college. This is also very applicable for those who really have no budget for daily school allowance like me.)"
At least don‚Äôt post this cause I feel it‚Äôs racist but if u feel it‚Äôs wrong just back out off it cause it‚Äôs none of you‚Äôre business
"FU dude!!!! You&#39;re a TRASH!..... So fuck this, why Im even listening to you. Nope, I just want to comment on your bullshit video.üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"A dad got his child a new bike so they go to the store to buy a helmet. <br><br>All of the helmets were different in colour and design and had different efficiency and toughness. <br><br>But being a child who&#39;s drawn to colours, he picks the brightest and most colourful one no matter the efficiency. <br><br>College degrees are the same way. You need them to look better to look more colourful to possible emplyers when you go job hunting. The sad reality is, you can be the smartest person in the room with no diploma and still have the lowest chance of employment. <br><br>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re worthless if you don&#39;t go to college, or that you&#39;re impressive if you do. <br><br>But go to college, get a diploma, have an easier chance of getting employed."
I agree with you
Your right
I&#39;m 13 yrs old so what do you have for ME?
shit!!! go to helll....
Ako ay filipino at block kita
You are alright that&#39;s you tell brother good luck..
That is your opinion. But my kids went to college and they are making good money as well.
What the hell men
"Hello, I&#39;m thinking to go straight to the workforce after high school graduation since its really not worth putting over 40 grand for a diploma. I also do not wanna face any debt. I&#39;ve considered working with trade jobs. Do students still have debt to pay after graduating college regardless of the scholarships they receive? What are your opinions towards this? People that don&#39;t go to college, do they still suceed in life? Do college required jobs pay more than non required college jobs?"
The fuck?
Interesting I wish mentor-apprenticeship would return publicly
"In the Philippines just get a Law, or Medicine degree. If anythjng else just skip it."
"Im a Filipino crane operator assign in oil rig. I earnd 2k US dollars  monthly. No need college degree for me,üòù"
Because only a little universities and colleges have quality education. I know someone with college degree but doesn&#39;t even know how to multiply binomial which is taught at early high school. Diploma for most of people is only a decoration

Why DAVID DIMUZIO Should NOT Make this video

"Why would you Interupt a topic like that, Oh so we filipinos are dumb?<br>Btw:love ya"
"I&#39;ve been having this kind of mentality since 2017 after I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and that had since been carried until college and I&#39;ve been telling people that college is a waste of time and I didn&#39;t want to be here at all. But it&#39;s the cycle in the Philippines, the norm, and most of my colleagues say that they want to finish college &quot;AT LEAST&quot; for the diploma/degree and call it a day. That never made sense to me and I really hated it. I want out of college, but if I did, I just didn&#39;t know what route to take in life. That&#39;s why I am glad I watched this video because I started going back to film making and video editing and growing a love for it. I&#39;d focus there and maybe I&#39;d find success in that, but hey at least I was doing what I love. It just sucks how it&#39;s really inspiring to just drop out after reading all these personal finance books and get things started but realize it&#39;s written in the US and the US is much different compared to The Philippines, but I don&#39;t know man, I am just frustrated. I am young and I don&#39;t know shit.<br>I just don&#39;t want to do 4 years of college and end up the same person as I am today. Heck I don&#39;t even go to college for learning, but I go for meeting people."
"Can you connect me to some people or something, i want to act, but i am lacking connection, i always join acting workshops"
Why can&#39;t we go to college
"Let&#39;s simply put it this way, Learn a Skill and Scale. It is worth scraping that traditional mentality that tells you to go to college, get a diploma and work abroad. If this is your mindset right now, you will end up working in a company all your life and hating your job. That means you will still end up financially struggling until your retirement. In addition, the sad reality is, you finished college not being financially equipped or educated. Schools do not teach financial education. Moreover, in school, intelligent children are pictured to be the winners and the average or low ability ones are losers. What a shame."
"Yes that‚Äôs right you‚Äôre very right  most of the rich people they never go to college  ,because they know what they want to do  like Donna Karan  only high school ,l liked Donna Karan fashion design    God bless ,"
Your right

Because our parents always taught us &quot;study so you can find a decent job&quot; not study and make your own business. Sad life.
"Sadly enough most companies need to see literally your college/university certificate/diploma before you&#39;re given the job. You can&#39;t simply say to your interwier you can fix elctric wires, or fix toilets fixtures. This may be true, but they (employers) need to see something from your college/university accomplishment."
"Colleges and universities do NOT give you skills. Skills are developed through experience and NOT through formal education. A good plumber, for example, is acquired through fixing fixtures - the try and error philosyphy."
"I always dont like entering school,  its such a waste of time but if you&#39;re a student and in the Networking Company, heres what i plan to do which i wanted to share,  maybe you can get an idea for me.

"Give any person hope, they can do whats their choice, depends on intent, yes they can"
Agree If your passion doesn‚Äôt need college degree. You feel wasting time in college if you don‚Äôt like what you are doing. <br>On the other hand studying is not a waste of time if its your passion. Specially if you feel delight whenever you learn something.
"Every job applications asked if you have high school and college education. But you&#39;re right you don&#39;t need college education but Filipinos were pressured by their parents. They take nursing, engineering, doctor, accounting, other profession.. At least they don&#39;t ask for handouts from the U. S government when they get here to work. The Americans goes to college they don&#39;t even know who the current president, or vice president is. That&#39;s pretty funny."
Why should I not go to college I‚Äôm a Filipino and I am eight years old
Skilled person nowadays can beat persons with a degree in terms of income generation and job opportunities.
I AGREE with you üíØ% . We&#39;re now in DIGITAL WORLD...College is obsolete and a waste of time and money! Like you said you can learn pretty much everything you need to know in YouTube or Google etc as long as you have internet! I don&#39;t encourage my kids to go to college but instead start learning online business and become successful entrepreneurs!  üòç
We shouldn&#39;t go to school at all! they just destroy our brain and make us stop thinking whats the real problem.
I&#39;m a filipino and I think that encouraging somebody to not go to college is not right because having knowledge about the job you&#39;re gonna take is really gonna help you
"A degree will save you, should your so called skill did not bring you to your dream. And please take into consideration that goldman sachs is not a reliable source. Remember how many times they screwed us over. Earning a college degree requires dedication, hardwork and SKILLS! <br><br>So to those who want to believe this guy. Take note that you are not him. You may not have the same skills that he has, but being educated academically gives you pride and respect to yourself that you can call yourself a &quot;college graduate.&quot; Who endured the pains and sacrifices it takes to earn that diploma."
"There are already many people who dont go to college and just focus on what they do. People who are in masonry construction laborers, auto/motorcycle mechanics, agriculture, clothing, drivers etc. Diploma and experience is like a ticket to other countries. Philippine population is just so huge that in order to survive some have to work abroad. Even business owners, doctors and engineer work abroad. Thats why some countries hate Philippines because filipino sometimes take jobs at a lower salary compare to others which in general i could say we export competitive workforce. Nevermind changing manufacturing/company location filipinos would just go to where it is. A college degree holder can assimilate well because he or she knows about following working hours, timeline, deadline, paper works, complying for requirements if needed, rules and regulations. Degree holders would have a decency to do homework and search what kind of situation is he/she will be going through in a paticular country. These things you cant expect much on a HS graduate, he/she might be jailed in an instant."
Strongly disagree!!!
<b>Well that&#39;s why I&#39;m taking college overseas.</b>
"I like your video, I&#39;m not a college degree holder but I&#39;m making money and have a great  job but also in today&#39;s generation there is a discrimination between college graduate and not college graduate level.. I am a filipina and I never regret if I don&#39;t have a college degree.. I&#39;ve been working for a very young age  so it&#39;s one of the reasons why I didn&#39;t make it to college . I&#39;ve been taught and trained  and now making money  so I guess college degree is just a plus bonus if I do have it.."
YES. BUT HOW CAN WE DO THAT IF THEY ARE CORRUPT OFFICIALS IN THE GOVERNMENT HOW CAN EDUCATION SYSTEM IMPROVE LIKE FROM FINLAND TO ADAPT IN PHILIPPINES??<br><br>IS THEIR A BETTER WAY TO SUSTAIN OUR FINANCIAL NEEDS?<br>THAN NOT TO GO IN COLLEGE ??
Chavit singson is the greatest filipino example for this topic
Don&#39;t compare your self to us ....we are not the same....
"You don&#39;t get the reason for college. It&#39;s not for the sole purpose of making money. College to me is brain exercise and expanding my knowledge and meeting people. Most of the stuff I learned in college I apply to my life today from caring for the environment, third world economics and finance. I want my kids to go to school to expand their knowledge and meet people. I&#39;m sure I can still learn from going back to college at my age. It&#39;s how you use the knowledge. Besides, the usual way to start a business is to earn that money first from jobs and learning from the industry and that is how I built up my business. I got the job because of my degree and I used the proceeds and experience from that job to start my business. Some of my friends never went to college and quite frankly, their minds are only about work and nothing else and their world views are quite flat. School is not all about money. Heck, I can argue why go to High School, I can learn all that stuff on the internet."
We still need to go to College to get a good job<br><br>Its a very important part when it comes to applying for a job in a huge company <br>We shouldn&#39;t really waste our chances to study for things we like to do<br><br>In my case i chose Computer Engineering since i wanted to know more about technologies.<br>Just because im knowledgable about technologies doesn&#39;t mean im good enough to make a game<br>I still need to learn how to do programming<br><br>For me College is a way to enhance your abilities<br>Not just some time wasting shit<br><br>Your point is invalid here
I been saying that a lot
Go to College to get a job ? J O B = Just over broke
You got 15% getting a job without finishing college. Plus where do I start working if I didn&#39;t even go to college?  If my passion is not in-demand to my country or super far from my home? My problem is where to start?
Many countries laugh at college diplomas from the philippines..... this is a country which is only just playing with the idea of a K-12 education.... The Philippines is still proud to export low - skilled slave labor to overseas instead of worldclass education.

Paano matutu ang bata kung hindi papaaralin. Sa pinas pa naman pinag aaral talaga natin mga anak natin kc yun lang ang mabibigay na yaman sa kanila at maging gabay nila sa paglaki. Hindi ka nmn cguro tatanggapin sa hospital kung hindi ka nurse. Mas maganda parin yung may pinag aralan. Kung sa inyu ok lang hindi makapag aral kasi it&#39;s just wasting your time sa pinoy hindi kahit gano kahirap ng magulang tinataguyod parin nila makapagtapos lang ng pag aaral ang mga anak. Kung trabaho mo ay gagawa lang ng music video at mag parami ng likes nasa saiyo din yan pero wla nmang benefits makukuha like sss or anuman paman i mean hindi habangbuhay yung pag yu2xtube. Pero i encouraged mga bata na mag aral wag tayong maging mang2x.
"I agree to you sir, mostly you can not pass your degree to your son or daughter, but you can teach them what you know and what you do"
We go to college<br><br>I&#39;m filipino
Well uhhh idk<br>But this news might be good for kpop fans<br>My teacher said maybe in colledge there will be no more filipino it will change to korean<br>All tho im kinda sad
"There&#39;s a rumour now, that Filipino subject is now removed on collages, and if that happens more than 800,000 Filipino subject teacher are going to get fired"
Nah..... I need to go to college for perfect job
"Well said. This is true skills and not diploma is essential. Look at the highest paid individuals they are athletes, actors, life coach.."
Here you go again David!!! Nonsense... If you have a child tell them don&#39;t go to college!
Having a college degree is not a guarantee for success. Pinay here. :)
"Nice video,,,,,but the problem is other company or government,,even you have skills they will search college degree,that&#39;s a requirements now,,,if your finish only in high school they will look you down,üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§and also to other college graduates are no proper work,,even they are college degree they still work at a waitress,or other works that not suitable for their degree,college degree is useless now,it&#39;s look only professional once you a graduate in college but not all are have a good job........"
Im Filipino here
mhmm
"For me, going to college is a necessity especially living in a third world country.<br>It will depend on a person&#39;s attitude on how they will attain success in life. <br>But a degree is a treasure. <br><br>I respect your opinion but I do not fully agree."
"Irresponsible and ignorant advice, even when coming from a first world country such as yours where it is more possible to do the thing your advocating. You need a college degree to even get your foot in the door in the ph. And what do you suggest people without college degrees do? Start businesses? And with what capital. Add on the 90% failure rate of startups.  It is much more feasible to go to college and get a stable income than go out a whim and try to make it youself. Thats hard to do in the weat, near impossible for filipinos in the phillippibes due to the various barriers to entry one will encounter there.  In conclusion david di muzio your just salty that you dont have a college degree and you claim you do well for yourself. But im sure as hell certain you got some family income whereas nost filipinos are living paycheck to paycheck"
This is just racist your letting people dreams down! i hate this channel
"Ako isang Pilipino, Meron akong HS Diploma at diploma sa kolehiyo. Marami akong napag-aralan yung bata pa ako. Ngayon meron na akong sariling negosyo at balak mag abroad. Kaya wag mong sasabihin na lahat ng pilipino hindi dapat mag-aral, Bobo lang nagsasabi ng ganun. Kung magkakaroon ako ng pagkakataon na mag aral sa ibang bansa gagawin ko. Kaya mga Kapwa kong pinoy, Wag magpapadala sa mga salita ng mga dayuhan, Lalo na sa estados unidos. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
Asians are crazy when it comes to education
I know so many people who finished college just for the sake of it. They just choose a random course.
"We are Filipinos most of all almost all of u Filipinos finished college why, because we need a diplomat for working what are u thinking aere doing fine we don&#39;t need opinions and if we didn&#39;t go to college how are we gonna leave, we have brains, we are humans,we are kind and u why are u telling people that we cannot go to college we are enough for people and are u telling us Filipinos are rude, crazy, no brains but sir we are Perfect just the way we are why are u telling that we need to got to collage and it is our choose and your not our God your like us humans pls don&#39;t take advantage of people that u don&#39;t know our life and decisions"
"I&#39;d like to clarify...I RESPECT YOUR OPINIONS. I&#39;m not a close minded person and I actually think it&#39;s very cool for you to talk about this.:-)<br><br>I understand the importance of skill but considering that you did situate this video to the Philippines, the system here is quite different. Surely, skill set is important but it doesnt mean that going to college will restrain developing a skill. The point of working for free comes in a slight chance. The Philippines is honestly unfair. Companies want to keep their reputations. Philippines is lacking jobs to offer. Sadly, it&#39;s survival of the best. (Only applies to Philippines in this current thing). <br><br>College gives you a starting point to work. At the very least, finishing college for most Filipinos is an opportunity to find better work to support their families. They may have skills but sometimes supporting the family in the most that they can will be the optimum choice.<br><br>Why college? Sometimes, we can&#39;t deny that the Philippine economy has its ups and downs. Some people often want to go international and taking higher education is a choice we would be likely to take. I mean, people here are underpaid and everything is becoming expensive.<br><br>Also, those master and successful entrepreneurs etc, they are the 1 percent that actually became successful. Being successful because of your skill set is great, no doubt about that, but most of us want stable high paying jobs in the economy. We want jobs that are sure to support the family that we are to create. I may be a great cook but if I want to be a top chef, a degree would definitely help my resume.<br><br>Structure is provided in college. What to do and what not to do.<br><br>In anyway, this comment means no offense. It&#39;s just the truth I believe in. College might be a waste of time for some people but it&#39;s probably because it&#39;s not being spent to its full capability."
"Pinoys go to college to get ahead in life, so they don&#39;t stay poor all their life. Pick a course degree programs  that will make you easily employable."
"Well I knew College was useless when i reached 2nd Yr College. After that i stopped going to school and talk to my mom honestly that a college degree would be useless when i work abroad. I guess i was right, my friends laughed at me since they graduated and I only got National Certificates. Well after 2 years I worked at a hotel in Guam and got promoted as a Manager. While my friends are stuck in a minimum wage LOL. I think the minum wage in dollars is 15-20$/Month in where my friends are working."
"It very important to realize that in 2nd and 3rd world countries, degree is way more useful than it is in the US. Please take your time and come here to China and live a few years you will find what I‚Äôm saying is the true. <br><br>Here in China, the absolute minimum requirement for most job is a bachelors degree. The reason is simple: too many applicants everyday, most of them have the skill they want, why wouldn‚Äôt they choose people with the highest degree from the best school? In reality, people with college degree in general have better skill set than those who don‚Äôt. <br><br>Interestingly, the more degree holders there are, the more important it becomes to have it: you need to get a better degree to get yourself more chance to show up for an interview. <br><br>I do agree, however, the moment you get to the office for job interview, your skill set becomes 100% to determine if you can get that job or not."
gusto kasi ng karamihan sa mga filipino instant yaman kala nila pag nakagraduate ng college milyonaryo na sila in the future kaya tuloy daming tambay tapos ang gusto nila trabaho ung my mataas na agad na sahod kahit kakagradute lang pag nd makahanap ng trabaho mg aaply abroad kahit taga hugas ng puwet at least dw mataas ang sahod mgsimula kasi kayo magaaply kahit mababa lang posisyon at least related pa dn sa tinapos nyo dun magsisimula ang growth then success.
"Uhm, I actually go to college for the reason to discover my hidden potentiality. The college i‚Äôve had helped me to build specific skills and develops my interest on it.

Why the hell do we need college anyways. ^œâ^
Very well said sir david
People go to college to get a degree just to pay off hundreds of thousands of dollars of student debts
Gosh.... just for me your adviced dont have any value at all.. im sorry. I want my kids to have a college degree if i can.
I learning English With your Video üòä!!.
Ummmm we go to college after grade 12....
<b>when you&#39;re a filipino</b> SANDALI LANG OK-
"I think <b>Why FIlipinos should not go to College * is totally the *Wrong Headline on this Article.  YOU  are encouraging Filipinos not to go to College b/cuz</b> you are saying that instead of goimg to College which in your opinion, is rather a waste of time,  they should just <br>choose to  <b>Develop a * technical Skills</b> that they are good at, and use that to  support them<br>selves financially all their life. <br><br>That might  work, for those people, who doesn*t want to go to College and would rather settle for just doing <b>technical Jobs</b> for the rest of their lives, but most people, normally, are not mentally geard that way. They would rather go to College and get a real relevant degree, and work for a stable, large Companies who could offer them and their families a life-long Stability, Health insurance Coverages, Retirement &amp; Pension Plan Benefits at the end of their working life. <br><br>Many Filipinos are in the HealthCare, Engineerings, Architectures, and Computer Science<br>b/cuz* they are good at it, and I really encourage them to keep  pursuing these field b/cuz<br>it really works for them, which also benefits all of us. <br><br>I just could not imagine, what the USA would be like with-out these Filipino Nurses and other Filipinos Healthcare Givers, they are the *nicest, gentliest, sympathetic, and  the most skilled and reliable people in the Hospitals.

"I think we all should go to college, we can learn so much in college, than watching you tube"
"Let us put it this way: we all have different callings in life. Some calling require college degrees, some don&#39;t. Certainly being a musician, or a juggler does not require college degree. You want to become a doctor? Then college degree and beyond is a must! That is non-negotiable. No one would like to be treated by some life skilled person alone.<br><br>I guess you haven&#39;t lived long enough in the Philippines to see what its like to live there. Even applying in SM as a saleslady and burger flipper at McDonalds requires some college. Few jobs, too many competition. Here in the US, you survive as long as you can read and physically able.<br><br>Bottomline is, each one needs to find his/her own purpose in life. Unfortunately, at 16 or 18 when people starts entering college, very few know what they really want in life, if a kid wants something, his/her parents or means aren&#39;t all in the same page. College degree will never ever be a waste of time. Ever!  Sometimes even famous successful people regret not finishing college. It&#39;s very dangerous to discourage someone from going to college. There is a reason why the first 2 years of college are just bunch of minor subjects- A lot of people are still figuring put what they want. Not everyone is lucky to find what they want at 8, 16 or even 35!"
we still need to study btw
"If you want to be a lawyer/engineer/doctor/geologist etc. you have to go to college, end of discussion"
"Keep seeing this dude on my page.. -_-<br>I wish he&#39;d grow up here in the Philippines with NOT ENOUGH MONEY so he&#39;d know what Education really means here. We ate not America or any foreign country because each country has their own priority. Why not make another vlog about this? Let&#39;s say Why Anericans don&#39;t need parents, or Why Mexicans can grow more than avocado? Honestly, do you hear yourself? Rather, do you think before you post? And why most of your vlogs are biased? To gain viewers, followers, or likers? You can vlog about anything without telling someone what to do and what nit to do especially if you&#39;re in a foreign country. üòëüòëüòë"
Here in Philippines if you have skills you still need to go to college. If you dont have Skill you really need to go college. Bcoz even thou u know u have skills people here or company here have a standard or qualification for every job.
skills is better than college degree..its all about mind set!
Some families here in the Philippines want their kids to finish school and earn a degree for an honor and have something o be proud of
actualy college is important to everyone which you can have more knowledge so do not make this offensive video
My Dad only finished Highschool yet he&#39;s able to get a job because of his skills on mechanism and has managed to give everything we need.
David Dimuzio....how can i reach you personally.
great..video!  really really true.
Sadly this is wrong... being Filipino I already realized how much people need it.
Why and iam a filipino filipinos are olso human like you i am sorry iam no t making a figth i am just protecting my country
All I have to say is sinapak ako ni budak. :&#39;(:&#39;(:&#39;(
I need to go to college cause my mom want me to be a doctor<br>Asian mom
Chinese are rich in Philippines doesn‚Äôt even speak English and Tagalog but there business skills makes them rich.. by using skilled people work for them pay them lesss..
"<b>sigh</b> if u only meet my mom. She forced my 3 sisters to go to college and they knew that they&#39;re dreams would never be alive because of my mom deciding for they&#39;re future. None of us did and now I am gonna go to college and be a business man and let my dreams die as I waste my life just looking in to oblivion, looking at hardware materials , and as I regret my every decision that I make."
I&#39;m fine in England sir. I&#39;m only going to college to educate others ...
Very inspiring David..I was focuse I‚Äôm finishing the course did not like..I want to focuse the thing I like creativity I have my submilation <br>Printer sewing machines.. I was I an do a lot of things with arts drawing and sewing it can make uniforms.. anything and plus you enjoy not the dead job I use to be it‚Äôs torture coming to work wish the time is over soon ..you don‚Äôt like just only to make few money...this skill will be more improve if you keep doing it..
I agree with you David ... skills learning in business..and do what your good at turn into profit..
not only americans watch this and filipinos watch this too and they are understand your language
"In my opinion its important to go attending college <br>So you can have a great nice job,and so that if you have a high degree in school others cant look down on you"
"Just because some people in the past became successful even without a degree, it doesnt mean college is useless. Those people became successful because they were at the right place, at the right time, picked the right series of choices, and with more than just a little luck. In short, their stars were lined up perfectly and they grabbed the opportunity. And to be honest, how often would that happen, and surely not everyone would be given that chance.<br><br>You said if you know how to build a house and fix cars that you can be successful. And then said that you can <i>learn</i> them online, why the fk would you choose learning from youtube videos instead of getting a degree for carpentry or even a 2 year course at TESDA. Using your time learning from youtube videos or using the same time learning at in a university and getting a degree.<br><br>Lets be honest, if youre a car shop owner and going to hire a worker. Would you hire the self tought guy or the guy with a college degree? And dont even dare give me the &quot;hardwork&quot; excuse, you cant put thaf on your resume. And if you finished a 3/4 yeae course, then that just proves you worked hard at college.<br><br>In this era, knowledge is power. Fixing cars and hammering wood wont give you millions of dollars in this day of age. Those people who became millionairs without a college degrees are innovators, and unless you can invent a flying car, a perpetual motion machine that gives infinite supply of energy, or new technology that can help cure diseases, etc. Expect yourself to be working 10+ hours a day in construction sites lifting cement getting paid minimum wage and compalining to the government how poor you are. This time youll realise how things wouldve changed if only you got a degree and can work at a higher position and getting the right amount of compensation for your work.<br><br>Kids, please go to school and help the next generations improve. Humanity wont advance just with men hammering wood and tightening loose screws, we need inventors that will create world changing technology, scientist that will discover new medicines that can cure cancer and other diseases, military personel that will help make the world safer, and many more profesions that is almost impossible to get from youtube videos.<br><br>I mean how can we discover places beyond our universe, if we dont even know how space and time works. The possibilies are limitless and knowledge is everywhere, you just need to go the extra mile to learn them."
"College degree to work on a supermarket or a call center? Are you serious? I&#39;ve worked in both and I don&#39;t have one. In fact, I&#39;m in IT now (programming) and I still don&#39;t have one. Just a course I took.<br><br>Although, I&#39;m not from the US or the Philippines."
"Kelangan mo pa ren atleast may napag-aralan lol. Pwede mo naman man put ung skills mo into work kahit kelan eh, may degree man o wala."
"Being a writer, an artist, an entertainer, a musician, a designer (except interior designing I guess), or a YouTuber and other more creative, artistic, and performative careers as well as sports-related careers and jobs wouldn&#39;t really need a college degree. It&#39;s all about skills really in these industries. A young child artist who is starting to paint and exhibit is just as equal as a Fine Arts graduate who do exhibit, though a graduated one is more knowledgeable in arts and with much more formal experience and practice, but both are working as an artist anyway."
"I want to be an artist and practice my craft in art but I also want to teach art like do workshops, seminars, summer schools, or to start an art academy for teaching students general education but with concentration to arts and culture. So in my case, I would build on my skill as an artist personally but  would still need at least an education degree to be more eligible to teach. Maybe a  training in business and entrepreneurship will also help. TESDA is also a good way to start building skills while learning also some applied general education or practical academic subjects in just few time and getting a certificate to be more able to be hired and work."
"The employment sector in the Philippines is really screwed up, a typical scenario of a pinoy fresh grad after getting interviewed by the HR:<br>&quot;You are applying for an entry level position, sorry, but you need 1 to 2 years work experience in order to qualify for this job...&quot;<br>Stupidity at its finest, entry level positions are suppose to be the foundation of every employee in order to gain work experience.<br>You are asking a fresh grad for some work experience for an entry level job that is supposed to give give them the experience they should need, self contradiction. Not every fresh grad are working students, and the what is annoying is most of the companies will not recognize your OJT experience."
Dear david dimunzo<br>Just so that you know filipinos deserve to go to colage becuse we deserve it and we are very hard working and we are proud of it we have all the right to do any thing and ilove bieng a fillipino
"It‚Äôs just like your saying those doctors, engineers, nurses, lawyers, teachers and all other filipino professionals who have a good career now made a bad decision in their life, and that decision is going to college and have an education.  Think of it bro."
"David, these successful people you are talking about didnt go to college because college has nothing to teach them that they dont know about. They are geniuses, do you see even 0.001% of our population as geniuses? How many Steve Jobs and Bill Gates earth has produced out of the over 7.6 billion people in the entire planet? I respect you men, but i think some John Smith in the US who dropped out of college believing he can be the next Kurt Cobain just ended up working in a deli shop. Out of 7.6 billion people there&#39;s only 1 Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Sir R. Branson etc, if this is the odds you wanted to play, why dont you just encourage Filipino to buy Lottery tickets? Majority of the Filipinos needs to learn more basic things from college before jumping into a business or specializes into something otherwise people will just take advantage of them when they succeed or make bad decision later on. I bet that guy that fixes your guitar can earn more if he is White and educated. I once needed a shoe shine in Paris and i&#39;ve been charged 18 Euro, do you know how much it cost in the Philippines, less than 1 Euro because there&#39;s so many of them doing the same thing. In the western world, Blue collar jobs paid well compare to the Philippines, i bet this is why you can say this and this is why we export a lot of Domestic helpers, Nurses, etc. And from this mentality our government have coined the phrase &quot;World-class Filipino workers&quot;, whomever thought of this phrase should have been fired talking about Filipinos like household products. Point is, there is no shortage of Blue collar jobs in the Philippines. Even in Call Centers, big companies in the US gets 20 heads of agent for the price of 1, how can you get a deal like this in Greenland? As a Filipino, if you plan to go abroad without a college degree no matter how smart you are you will end up on slave jobs, like DH, burger flippers etc., with a degree you can be the Boss of the burger flippers and that is all because of the magic paper called Degree. Remember, world is racist and as Filipino; no men will take your word for a Degree. Oh btw, i went to the Career portal of Goldman Sachs, they&#39;re asking your Degree for positions."
I&#39;m Filipino and some of my family were graduated from college.

"Spectacularly great video, David.  I am sure it helped many."
How can you apply for a job in the philippines if you dont have a degree...philippines has less jobs for college undergraduates.
Filipinos Filipinos Filipinos.. it&#39;s always about Filipinos
just saying its kinda rude to put on a video specificaly filipinos not to go to collage where are you from? america? what if i said Americans shouldn&#39;t go to collage but i respect your opinion
I think the better premise is: it is wrong to assume that a college diploma ensures a job. It can give you a chance but it doesn&#39;t guarantee anything.
"I totally agree with your video. As an almost sixty two year old guy that never went to college but instead went to a Trade High School and took Printing. From 1974 until 1998 when I retired I made a really good living of ten American dollars and hour in 1974 and $50,000.00 a year in 1998.<br>     On the other hand I can see why this would be hard for a lot of Filipino&#39;s to grasp (thus the 2,000 dislikes)  LOL!  I am married to a Filipina and have spent almost tow years over there in Manila. College is drilled into them, being told they will never be anything without it. Then most get a degree in business management or engineering and when they graduate work in  a call center. I agree that not going to college can be time well spent just like you said. <br>     Unless of course you have a specific trade like one of my wife&#39;s daughters is a CPA and the other a computer science, and another friend an architect that draws up plans for Philippine malls, they all benefited from a college education. But by far in Manila anyway most do not."
"Bill Gates didn&#39;t finish college but smart enough to score 1590/1600 on the SAT. He went to Harvard as well, same as Zuckerberg. These people are wealthy enough to start their own business, most Filipinos aren&#39;t. Some people are research-inclined and/or curious about something and being successful is not about how much money you make, not all the time."
DUTERTE! DUTERTE! DUTERTE! DUTERTE!
My sister is graduating college  T_T
"I hear you David, I myself have education on Management; working while I was achieving it. I also have a background on Music and Food. I have experience in the YOUTH ministry as well. I work for healthcare now, and I value my work ethics to the core - something that a majority of my co-workers (mainly Filipino) will NEVER HAVE COGNIZANCE.  <br><br>People that are NARROW-MINDED will never understand what you just mentioned here in this video. I am not rich, I value understanding - and I get you bro.<br><br>What pisses me off is how people let the words go to their ears but fail to understand what you mean - and that is because of lowbrow people. You try to explain and expand the logic and yet people (haters) have already closed their doors.<br><br>I AM A FILIPINO CANADIAN, I am proud of my heritage, the greatness of what makes the Filipino - NOT THE BAD HABITS that a lot of my countrymen/countrywomen continue to hold on to (I don&#39;t know why)<br><br>Truth really does wonders, two to be exact - it sets you free, AND IT HURTS!"
This option of not going to college and instead study skill sets online is a great idea if anyone actually has available internet and a gadget to use for learning which a very few filipinos have and plus certain skill sets require equipment and materials for learning which some colleges i think would have for free so i think it&#39;s depended on what skill you want to learn whether or not you can get your dream job even if without a college degree.
"Education is the only way out of poverty. Not the lotto, not the youtube.."
We go to college
"You still need to go to college, cause most companies will look for that... There&#39;s nothing we can do about that."
i love your videos they are just realistic.. ive learn the things that i did it wrong way this inspired me thank you üòç
"I think you should stop comparing your way of living to the way of living in the Philippines. I mean you are in US after all. People have a choice to go to college or not. But in the Philippines you need a college degree to get an average paid job.  What works for you may not work for others especially for a third world country. Skilled people like plumbers, welders, electricians are paid low unless you want to be an OFW in which case not everyone is lucky. You work in entertainment and got rich. There are lots of washed up actors and actresses in the Philippines which means that entertainment is not a secure job."
"yes college degrees are becoming less valuable today but in a country like the Philippines, having a degree is an &quot;all or nothing&quot; thing. i always tell my parents if i was born in japan or the US i probably won&#39;t go to college or just get a 2 year course. good topic though"
I LOVE THIS
"Nah I say go to college, life is all about learning and discovering and making the most out of everything, not dropping everything."
"Go to college if you have to, don&#39;t go to College if you don&#39;t have to.<br>College is not for everyone, so if you&#39;re going to College.<br>Make it count."
"Many Filipino families set a minimum level of education for themselves, and to most, it&#39;s a college education. Many do it for status, others do it &quot;to be safe&quot; as you say. If someone chooses to engage in business, for example, their parents probably may want him to finish college first.  Is it a waste of time? For most, no. It&#39;s important how others look at your family or clan. And that&#39;s what you&#39;re missing. Is your family a bunch of dropouts? That would be embarassing. Filipinos pride themselves to being educated, and we&#39;re not about to abandon that notion."
"So what is the purpose of college then ah, It&#39;s only frickin 4 years! Okay I understand you, but taking a degree is learning frickin skills, just frickin listen. What about laws?  There will be no politicians, lawyers! Such non sense topic. And you said that learn online, what if other people don&#39;t have access to the internet. WTF"
"The thing is, most jobs in the Philippines require &quot;Must have this degree, or that degree. - or must be a 4 year degree holder&quot;"
This is so true.
You can be a lawyer for free?
Lets not go to schol...That&#39;s a great advice of you...
why don&#39;t you try to come in the Philippines and make an actual speech and let see...
nah I&#39;m gonna be a cop so I&#39;m going to college
"mapait ang buhay namin nuon talagang hindi ko maano, talagang hirap kami syempre, pero bilib parin ako kay mama sa gitna ng pait . smile parin sya, dun ko nakita na dapat hindi nega.kasi kahit anung pait ng buhay kayang tong pasarapin , Parang Nescafe Creamy white. ito lang ang may nestle Milk, walang pait tinaggal namin yun pait para maka bangon kami. ikaw ?? para kanino ka Bumabangon ?"
"college is only four years of your life, sometimes 6-10.  don&#39;t think that it won&#39;t help you find a better paying job and meet some interesting people along the way.  having a high school diploma in the philippines amount to only $100 per paycheck.  you can&#39;t become an entrepreneur if you can&#39;t even feed yourself, or your family with a high school diploma.  <br><br>i would recommend going to college only for the following degrees: <br><br>1. engineering(comp sci, or ee)<br>2. law<br>3. medicine<br>4. teacher/professor<br>5. pilot<br><br>do what you love best, and don&#39;t spend years of your life learning something you&#39;re not passionate about"
who gave them the right to go to college
"Yes I was the one who went to college to get a Film Degree, did mostly writing papers, film history, theory etc. I was totally unprepared for the work force, had no skills had to get a hands on program in graphic design and even then it was so hard to get my foot in the door in the industry. I eventually just started my own design business. I really just thought a degree was this magic document that equals success and when it didn‚Äôt it was a rude awakening. Teaching my kids to do different. Matter of fact we even homeschool, and I‚Äôm pretty big on having them learn things that I know are applicable and have a goal to graduate early. We do live in a different age now. Took me awhile though to catch on. *Note Speaking from an American experience ."
Our culture values school or education so much. While those skill set you are pertaining to is also called &quot;hobbies&quot; here in the philippines. This video is somehow eye opener though i guess you forget to look at the bigger picture and see all the corner of this topic.
"&quot;call center&quot; as a random job?<br>I think the huge skill set requires in our industry is a BIG heart, who knows how to do analytical thinking, strong decision making, know the meaning the customer service and act on it and the list goes on...<br><br>I really respect your opinion but isnt this counter intuitive with your other video about &quot;dating girls in the philippines&quot;"
"tell that to the europeans and the anericans if they agree you might be totally right... for engineering and other professional courses no matter how you interact and watch other people do it youll never learn the skills,, college is a refinement of everything  .. you learn the skills plus the ethics that goes with it..."
"True, you can have a job without a college diploma. Yes, some skills can be learned without going to college. But i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a waste of time going to college at all,  i don‚Äôt know about others but i‚Äôve definitely gained something out of it. I have a good paying job and i‚Äôm satisfied. Yes, there are people who decided to not go to college and are successful. But there are also a number of successful degree holders out there, so i don‚Äôt see the need to opt out college in one‚Äôs life choices especially if there‚Äôs an opportunity."

"for a matter of manner, i subsequently got offended but i guess you&#39;re right. having an entrepreneur job or making your own business is better than getting a highly course achievement to make your parents proud. well.... for me though, i always slack on my house since i stopped going to school. my parents deliberately wants me to go to college even though i don&#39;t have proper inspiration to my own course, or any other course. but i guess wasting my life as a social discriminatory background for my parents is as bad as i can be. but thinking back over the years i&#39;ve studied, i become more and more relatable to immature adults since then. i don&#39;t have to work hard and just wasting my life into unnecessary things like right now. but i might grow tired of living a lie and make something out of it. my worst enemy right now is myself. well, filipinos are more diligent and sophisticated than a rich family. they can be bound on vast choices with treasures of life. even to pursue something doesn&#39;t have to be knowledgeable due to studying, but LEARNING ways."
"This is a very interesting mindset but this is only true if you have a talent that can earn you money, or if you got lucky and the skill that you developed by yourself become useful in the future. the problem is the Philippines is a 3rd world country , yes he mentioned some people who became successful without going to college but compare those numbers to the amount of people who are not financially stable because they didn&#39;t went to college. for the examples the he gave like plumber, car mechanic,electrician etc. those are very low paying job in the Philippines even lower than the minimum salary.  just remember not all people are born equal,some are born with talent and some develop it, are natural born genius some study until their eyeballs popped out, It is still best to study first and if you really don&#39;t want it and you found other things that is worth your time then you can quit."
How bout you dont go to college idc if you are done with school how bout ur future sons or daughters!
we dont need collage we got tesda it only take 2 months and your done
"i agree, i think most filipinos should just go to trade schools!  which is actually very popular nowadays and getting quite expensive as in the case of benide college, ultra expensive school of vey rich people so that their children can get an associates in becoming maitre&#39;d&#39;s or line cook in some fancy pants restaurant abroad."
"I respect your opinion but if you are aiming for a job here, most companies requires at least college level."
"Don&#39;t suggest this to kids, to Filipino kids/students, or anyone. And what work for free????, for 2 weeks??? for a year??? nobody will work for free. Going to college and to university will give you the most valuable skills, skills you need to lead a successful and happy life ( but that depends on what success means to you). School is not the only place to learn, at home and at work, are places where you apply or practice what you learn in school and work experience is the best teacher, so work after graduation, and continue improving on where you would like to improve on. As ¬†parents, who went to college and univesity both in our home countries and in our country of residence, we encourage kids to finish school but not depriving them of things they love to do, children need parents guidance when they are still too young to decide for themselves. It is true there are people who are successfull even without a degree but most of them just dropped out since they were already starting something else. See, one example is Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, he is Lloyd Blankfein because he went to school:). Bear in my mind your parents just want the best for you, know and decide what is really best for you, be intelligent,have an independent mind, ¬†and not easily influenced by not so good suggestions around."
"Many business [merchandise, all other business, and fast food chains] require a college degree or at least collage level."
"Even if i am a filipino doesn&#39;t mean i dont get to go to college, then to make it fair american&#39;s cant also go to college. Because every people gets to go to college, people can to whatever they want. With special skill sets or not. Please dont force them to go to college"
the world sucks!!! haha humanity sucks
dont be literate be illiterate thats the secret of being wise
"Yes I agree you don&#39;t need a college degree to succeed in life, but its not for all... some people are just too afraid to take risks, some people don&#39;t have the mental and emotional make up to become entrepreneur, and some people are just to afraid to fail so they want to be on the safe side always..."
You really dont need a degree to be successful in life.
"Well, yeah out of money and laziness are the things I have in mind now.."
"When I lived in the states from 2 years old and up until my 36th B-Day, my friends went to college and still to this day has not applied or was able to get a job in their field, except one,  we call him Dr Wong,  but the rest of us became successful out of our degrees and earn great income, a beautiful house and a nice car.  <br><br>I currently moved back to my home country and I&#39;m doing real great after retirement out of being a pro dancer. I bought a house with my current salary, and waiting to buy a new motorcycle since I&#39;m going through a midlife crisis, lol.  Degrees can be useful depending on what.  What we should look at is skill jobs,  carpentry, wielding, plumbing,  these jobs are necessary and will never go out of business,  therefore cementing the idea that not going to college is an end all to living fincancially stable meaningful life.  College is not for everyone."

"It&#39;s not fair, But I don&#39;t care"
It is actually true in Sweden also. Sweden I think is the country where it&#39;s the least profitable to go to college
"In the job market with big companies, you will not qualify or be a candidate for high-paying,  high-level positions. Get real."
That&#39;s true..<br>even in Pres. Marcos time..<br>as long as you have the skill you are hired.
Ouch...that insulted the whole me<br>(The title)
Unfortunately ....many Employer&#39;s in the Philippines will not even interview someone without a college degree ...you touched on this...But a unique skill is a good idea.
"This is true in my opinion, I didn&#39;t go to college, now I am self teaching my way through photography, it is hard work though, I had to do so many free sessions just to test myself out and practice, but now I am able to charge money, my 3 hour session is costing same as a friend of mine who graduated in college earn in a month... I am still learning tho, many people will usually look down on you because you haven&#39;t gone to college and that they think you are stupid and can&#39;t do anything. I had to do other jobs to earn money while I am self studying what I do now. I was working in a restaurant once and our manager there haven&#39;t been gone to college, and I asked her how she got the job that pays so much, she said she has been working in the industry at a very young age, and that college degree doesn&#39;t matter most of the time, when they are hiring people, they require people with skills and good attitude, and that good attitude and skills will open many doors...."

I agree. There are so many things that you cannot learn from the university like strategy and skills.  And a person&#39;s future will depend on him not with what school he was from. It takes &quot;diskarte&quot; to be succesful in life.
Learning these things won‚Äôt help me pay bills
"I Don&#39;t know, am still confuse am gonna graduate in senior high school this year in 2018 march. I don&#39;t know if am gonna go to college because they say that if you don&#39;t finish collage you cannot work. Specially in the philippines and other countries so. I can&#39;t decide. If I&#39;m not going collage. To be honest in my view that I have many skill And a fast leaner just looking ang watching people do. I can really learn fast by days, months and years. <br><br>My interest is Building or making art in building Cooking, Music in insturments, cleaning, electric circuts. and some random stuff that I usually use in the daily basis to live my life. But even so the down side is that Even I have all this Skill My Social skill is never been improve due to improve the other stuff that  I mentioned that I learn my skills<br><br>If I&#39;m Going to collage Am gonna be An I.T Student do U think I Could Fit in my degree to my skill set ."

"Your wrong Philippines even in Europe,middle east i think also in America need diploma in your work if you don&#39;t go to study"
But the problem here in the Philippines is more on college level in application.. but many are not skilled and palakasan system is always there..  <br>Palakasan system means if u have a close friend or a family in a company you are priority....<br>That is a main problem ..
"Just like i thought while reading a large bundles of papers that has many theories for me to study for my exams and i start thinking that &quot; it should be more on skills speciafications  than theoretical specialties because nowadays skills matters than titles or laude , because those who doesnt have college degree or just a regular student who has weak in theories but has a skills has a faster to have jobs than those who does has titles or degrees&quot; and i watch this videos this makes me strengthen my views and thanks to you im not alone who has the same mentality like you<br><br><br>By the way im a filipino<br><br>Thanks men for this video"

"Thank you for this information, you in lighten my mind. <br>I am a 3rd yr college in a specific school( I&#39;m not gonna mention what school I&#39;m in) for the past 3 yrs I&#39;ve been struggling to my studies, it doesn&#39;t inhance my skills, it only gives me pressure  so I came up to the realization that I must do what I love, what I&#39;m good at etc...<br>Thank you for this information :)<br>It helped me."
I disagree. It&#39;s true that not all things that you have learned on college is applied to your work but it gives you knowledge to help other people that you yourself cannot use. And not all people have the vision of their future like you but learning helps them know what they want to do. No one can say that what you learn is useless. You should think what both sides advantage and disadvantage and not thoroughly stop people from doing something.<br><br>Be open-minded
"I went to a school named JoBS Academy back in 2010 here in Davao, since at that time they were the only ones offering multimedia design courses and since it was run by a money hungry President and a new Dean who got power hungry. Me and my batchmates learned more thru OJTs than what the school taught us, though the some of the instructors at the school did taught us the basics but with their outdated equipment , some questionable staff actions and one whole semester wasted when no other instructor went in to teach us about Motion Graphics and having to pay for that whole semester ended up being a huge waste of time. The school ended up closing in 2014. Good riddance. By now, me and my group of friends who &quot;survived&quot; that mess are working online instead and we are still learning more."
Make sense David  :)  Thanks
"college degrees are not valueable .. right, in my case it was the difference between driving<br>a tricycle for a living to making six figures in the comfort of my own home office from being <br>a state scholar to an IT professional, earning to save for a business and now being an <br>occasional youtube comment lurker. Listen to your Kuya<br><br>To any Filipino student reading this comment open your eyes in the situation we have <br>right now in this country. The culture , values and state of commerce. One may argue that <br>the uploader&#39;s points on acquiring skills and apprenticeship is key to success <br>but in the state where our country is right now it doesnt apply to everything and everyone.<br><br>How many companies let alone private individuals, professionals are taking in apprentices ?<br>lets take guitar luthiership from his example, do you think Jon Dela Cruz and Max Rufo <br>would teach you trade secrets like best graphic layout plan? relic techniques? pickup settings etc <br>Do you seriously expect these pros would teach and take you in ? they having no debts from <br>you and you only promising hardwork , passion and dedication like in an anime or something ? lol <br>pardon the humor be  just be realistic. <br><br>Yes you can learn basic stuff like adjustment skills from the internet , but all self respecting <br>guitar owner would study these themselves. We can talk repair fee income here<br>but seriously how many people do you know owns a guitar worth of repair instead of the owner <br>just buying a new one. How many parents are willing to buy crafting tools and hard wood<br>for you to &quot;practice&quot; on? not to mention availability of those here in the Philippines<br><br>lets try car repair or painting you can try to study youtube videos for months yeah but do you <br>seriously expect a company to let you touch a customer&#39;s car engine for &quot;training&quot; <br>purposes? i bet your parents doesnt even let you drive the familys car let alone <br>&quot;butingting&quot; the makina for the sake of self studying lol Can someone name a succesful filipino<br> company that values self taught knowledge than a college diploma aside from Tesda ?<br><br>Bottomline here is get your college degree but make sure you like what you take up , you <br>work you save up and once you have the money you can take whichever direction / passion <br>you may wanna go. Even if you fail you have a safety net where you can come back to.<br>Theres a big difference on just being famous , satisfying your ego with praises and living of it <br>upto who knows when and being able to plan for your future , achieving goals and <br>getting recognition for real success like learning to juggle or make videos of why a former <br>US colonized country country cant get rich ... just kidding üòÅ"

"Yeah i totally agree<br>Here in the phils people with a college degree couldn&#39;t find a job that fit there degree<br><br>Some not all are arrogant, boasting that &quot;hey i got a college degree&quot; but you know what because of there self entitlement they end up a failure<br><br>Some get a job way too far from what they&#39;ve studied and become successfull<br><br>We&#39;ll i&#39;m not saying going to college is bad or i discourage everyone not to go to college <br><br>I&#39;t will really depend on you<br><br>I appreciate this video<br>So much this means a lot to me"

"If you want to be an actor, singer, porn star, dancer, comedian or be a bum, yes you don&#39;t need to go to college(but even most great actor, comedian, singer and dancer did go to some art school, one example is robin williams, and rowan atkinson to name a few). <br><br>What your preaching is idiotic, it&#39;s actually racist! Not all Filipinos are in the service or entertainment industry. <br><br>Youtube should put your site down."
I stopped listening after hearing you encourage the youth to not go to college.
Fuck I hate high school it the worst
"Sry but in the ph what your degree is, counts because the interviews is based on your school and how good your school is.."
"They based your skills on interviews, some exams... Which, duh, super biased. I&#39;m a Food Tech grad now working as a government employee in a municipality. I have no working experience related to my degree except OJT. I really wanted to pursue music or culinary but everyone around me just fell apart during teenage days."

"Most of the IT companies don‚Äôt take into account applicant&#39;s educational background but they consider them based on their skills. Programming languages and its related stuff can be learned online. I actually learned Ruby on Rails through <a href=""http://lynda.com/"">lynda.com</a> and youtube.  However there are lots of  job opportunities for those with college degrees especially in the Philippines and some establishments here need you to be a college grad to qualify for the job even if the task are easy to do."
"This is very true, but the case was most companies are looking for diplomas in my case I was just a junior high school student and could work like in the industry, practicality could teach us more than college"
I&#39;m offended (jk)
"Here is one thing you got wrong. Call Centers nowadays just require a high school degree and a specific skill set. No need for college degrees. You just need accent, good English, propper grammer and good typing speed. I know so cause I&#39;m applying to be a call center and underwent training to gain those skills. That aside, thanks, this is really helpful for me. However, I did study in college until I was forced to stop but I now think I wasted those 3 years..."
"This is on a case-to-case basis. Don&#39;t go to college just because you need to go to college. Go to college if you truly want to have a career that requires college degree. Happiness and career contentment does not necessarily about earning a lot of money. If you do not want to build houses or fix stuff, and like you want to be a lawyer, this advice is terrible. What is important is you maximize your time and learn the necessary skills for a career that you truly want."
"This is true, but in the Philippines there are already many people who have vocational skills. The shortage of skills like hairdressing, car mechanic, plumbing, is in the west, but how do you get there? You&#39;d &#39;need&#39; a degree to even get your foot in the door. It&#39;s sad but Filipino mentality looks down on the &#39;uneducated&#39; even if they have a vocation."
"I agree with you at some point. My father doesn&#39;t have a college degree yet he managed to be a successful person in his own way, all through his hardwork, skills and experiences. However, most of the companies make college degrees as pre-requisite to employment. Sad truth but we can&#39;t deny it, even though you are very skillful at a certain field or area. For me, it is still important to go to school, since it is still the most available source where you can acquire a particular skill, plus the degree. Nowadays, I think it&#39;s risky to go to battle field without an armor. Nevertheless, I hope this misconceptions will be changed in the future so that skill will be really the pre-requisite to employment rather than the degree."

"In the Philippines, going to college is like going back to high school."
What if &quot;Some schools(college) teach you skills like tesda&quot; and kto12 program teach kids skills so they could either choose go to college idk why or work
I like how you said that professionals like doctors and engineers should actually go to college. It means you really know what youre saying and made me interested in the whole video
You really Dont Know
Filipinos Go To College You Just Dont Kniw
Ohhhh.... Thats why many Filipinos are uneducated..
true maan wasting money shit. In order to  respect parents  no choice haayyzzz
I&#39;m wasting my life right now.
"Too late. I already wasted my 6 years just to finish one degree. Now, I do self learn to the profession i love."
"Omg you totally took the words outta my mouth. THIS is what I wanted to tell my parents, and other people in my country, that we are wasting the students&#39; time, money and effort in college to just retake those subjects taken from grade school and high school! OMG I AM CRYING! You are right! What people need to learn are skills, cuz knowledge is basically everywhere, on the internet, and just like you said FREE! But no! They are so set on that piece of paper and then after college graduation, came the hiring for jobs then what they&#39;ll say? They need employees who have 2yrs of experience. Like wtf? A fresh graduate looking for job to gain experience is being asked if he or she has one. It is totally bullcrap and annoying. I, for one, is craving to earn some skills that I want. But I can&#39;t. Cuz my family and relatives don&#39;t want me to. It&#39;s so annoying. They just don&#39;t get the idea that we all are wasting money for nothing cuz we are basically being taught in college the THEORIES not the practical skills that we need for that particular course.<br>This is getting too long, but thank you! You earned yourself a subscriber. Thank you so much for this insight. And I think this would also be applicable for other nationality as well. They should start opening up their minds that what they need to teach to their students are PRACTICAL SKILLS not just memorization and other stuff."
BPO is not a random job. Speaking English is a skill. Not everyone can do that for 8 hours over the phone unless you&#39;re a native speaker. lol
Because we are the poorest country
i agree with that.. same as my point of view..
"most of the time it doesn&#39;t work companies are always check your degree for your credibility , I am an undergrad of 9 units left in college and has skills for programming I develop the MIS of one of the department of the company and I see the potential of my program it will increase their productivity dramatically but because I am just an office staff and undergrad all of my officemate specially my supervisor holding back my dry run for the program I only need 3 days of dry run without delays to their productivity but I face nonsense alibi from them and now I was force to finish my college"
"Yes, it&#39;s a waste of time but that&#39;s the only way you can get your diploma."
Two thumbs up bro
this specific mom told my mom that her son took a vocational course (known as TESDA in PH) and after 6mons of training the TESDA itself made her son flew over to Taiwan. In just a year her son bought a house and a car. He didn&#39;t even go to college and now he&#39;s still working in Taiwan. My mom and I plan to do the same. I&#39;ve been in 4yr course before (stop in my 2nd yr) but it&#39;s hard for me &#39;cause I don&#39;t really like the course I&#39;ve taken. I&#39;m a practical person and academics&#39; not my match so I&#39;m hoping for this upcoming opportunity. I&#39;m 100% agree with this &#39;cause school didn&#39;t teach everything about life thou college degree&#39;s are must have (for jobs)
Can you name one Filipino who did not go to college or had any degree at all that became a billionaire? Name one Filipino who came from a very low poverty line household who became a a billionaire then I will believe you.
Nein nein nein nein eniiiiennnn!!!
"I agree its better to have a skill/talent rather than a degree. Pretty mind opening. But still its good to have a college degree. I would want my kids to go to college, but at the same time having a skill and talent."
"Henry Sy, Gokongwei, &amp; Socorro Ramos (owner and founder of National Book Store) are some of the Filipinos who didn&#39;t even go to college but now earn billions of money!"
"Seriously , if there is a brain transplant? I&#39;d choose yours because it hasn&#39;t been used."
I respect your opinion and understand your insight but college will provide more oppurtunity to every individual and will be able to help our country too and besides people who are down in the gutters or almost there have college as a hope to rise above poverty and life&#39;s hardship.
why
What a seriously misleading video. Do your research!
There is a reason ehy you Americsn built a &quot;UNIVERSITY&quot; of The Philippines some of the people who did something very good in history actually are Filipinos who go to colleges!!! There was even one of our Filipino presidents who actually took his BAR exam in prison being the university of the philippines TOPNOTCHERS. And yes I am a Filipino.

I depends cause I&#39;m a Pilot and I need to go to college on aeronautics schools before taking flight hours..
good content ..but you might wanna change the video title its abit strong for the majority of audience
It applies if they actually pay attention in high school and high schools care more about their students rather than their ranking... This happens quite often
"It depends on the regions and how determine you are to pursue your prefer job in the Philippines. Unlike Manila that has a lot of options for everyone to work on like in entertainment, culinary, etc., in other regions, you need a college degree, or just graduate in High School to work. Though with the internet, people can share their art and get recognize, create videos for video sharing websites, patreon supported services, and many more because the internet has broaden the opportunities for individuals especially Filipinos. Not all Filipinos can get a degree, but there are some who wants to get that degree and pursue it.<br><br>So don&#39;t just say Filipinos shouldn&#39;t go to college because there are factors to consider why they should get a college degree."
ur right.. we should develop skills
"I think its a Case to Case basis, depends on what industry your skill will be most used and needed. This argument can only be applied to Tech , Media and Art based skills which require little to no use of knowledge about science, math, etc."
"Ideally everyone should consider going to college if your career path in the sciences and for licensed practices. If you just take up  a course just to fulfill a duty, then you are setting yourself up to waste 4 years. I am an undergrad because of circumstance, but my love for learning new skill sets is enough backup. I have been in the same company for a decade and have seen college graduates have a hard time learning skill sets they&#39;d need to get in this company. Titles and degrees work when a company requires them but it doesn&#39;t guarantee you will be skilled enough for the position. <br><br>I&#39;d like to add to that parents should teach their kids skills at home too because it will come in handy in the future. Comprehension, spatial intelligence, organizational skills, grammar, attention to detail are skills that can be learned at home. I am a single parent and my daughters have jobs despite of not setting foot in college. One is skilled in organizing and management while one is a gifted writer- her comprehension beats officemates who have degrees. <br><br>Para sa nakakabasa, hindi ako lumaki sa US, sinuwerte lang ako na binasahan ako ng libro ng nanay ko bago matulog, hinayaan ako magbungkag ng record player at TV namin, hinayaan din akong maglaro ng makeup - para sa akin lahat ng laro katumbas ng pag-aral."
"I worked abroad before and its true that you don&#39;t NECESSARILY NEED a degree to get a job. I know a lot of people who finished college that are working on jobs that are not related to the course they studied. I was offered many times for a job as an educational consultant and a wordpress website designer / graphic artist (ik, two different jobs but i did work those jobs at the same time while in abroad) and I always tell them I that im not confident enough to apply and accept the offer because I don&#39;t have any degree to present, but the always tell me that skills, knowledge and discipline is far more important for the employers than a piece of paper stating that you finished what ever course you took. <br><br>IDENTIFY THE SKILLS YOUR GOOD AT, MASTER IT AND &quot;FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL PAY YOU TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE&quot;.<br><br>Edit: now I work as a freelance graphic artist and web developer, still studying more ways to improve my skills on those area. Learning more skills, video editing, t shirt printing, item customization, etc.."
Ano pa nga ba eh Tamad kaseng magaral na kagaya ko. üòéüòè
"The only good reason what I know when going to college is to develop your skills. Well, I guess I haven&#39;t knew that I had a thing on programming and design if I didn&#39;t went to college and be a burden to my parents back then. The point is,  going to college is great and you can have lots of great opportunities, but the only wrong about here is that some of the people that I&#39;ve met in college always said that they were placed in a wrong course which is a waste of time and a waste of money. I guess you have to think about it if you really need to go to college or not. Great video David."
well that is true  so many college graduate that are not appropriate to thier job
Why Should David DiMuzio Be a Youtuber
Uhm... How am I gonna get rich and get capital for business. I still need a degree to work Atleast A FEW YRS
"I respect your opinion David. But we other people actually want to finish college to accomplish something in life like getting recognition. And yes Im like you, a straight A+ student that is also a Filipino but other people have actual dreams that want them to become true. I respect your opinion but theres something wrong in what you said... the word &quot;encourage&quot; I mean not roasting or hating but why are you saying that we should not go to college. I mean we have our dreams that we want to achieve and that is getting a real and awarding job depending on what life you took. I mean, I cant relate to you that much cuz Im only 11 also in colleges here are not free. If your talking about the public ones, but colleges here are NOT free. If you want to take a semister here its like you have to pay a little amount of money specifically pesos (the currency in PH). so yah I dont.. what should I call this.... ummmmmm....... go with the flow of your opinion and if your saying that dont waste your life in college well not like you. people wont do that because thats life. And yeah you got rich because of youtube but others cant tie with your perspective on life yah you didnt went to college so you had ups and downs but what if other people actually followed your &quot;good&quot; advice they will experience the same thing but what if they didnt get to your life now.... what they expected to be. Yeah Im still 11 and still dumb than any other but I have a dream and everybody else. Plus its hard to get to get success if you actually didnt get your diploma"
True skills is more important than a degree
We filipinos had a big dream we filipinos are smart
D fudge man
I wish i didn&#39;t have to go to college :/

"In my opinion youre half right and half wrong. Think it twice if all filipinos will not go to college. It means 70 percent of filipinos will be an OFW because here in the philippines,  we have a lack of oppotunities to earn money.<br>I agree eduction is not for all, thats true. Because if all  people are having college degree , who will plant vegetable who will drive buses and jeepny. <br>Its a matter of oppotunities. And balances. But education and going to college is  also  important.<br>I do not have a degree diploma but i earned more than a most of any college grad people, in fact i am only a vocational graduate. But still i prefer my child to be a college graduate someday."

"Im currently a college student. It&#39;s all about choosing the right university. i never regretted going to college because the university molds us to go deeper, be critical and do our best to contribute someday to the national development. I&#39;ve developed a wider sense of understanding, on why Filipinos are like this and that. And on what do we have to do to cut these freaking capitalism which only the outsiders benefit from."
im not sure the mindset of those that went college are different from those that did not so to me college is worth going at
College degree is a requirement here in Philippines. You need a diploma to get a job in Phils. Every company looking for degree as a minimum requirement.
"Mr. David Muzio please do understand that in reality without a college diploma no one can  get a decent job as I recall my college teacher before in -order to get a decent job 4 things are needed knowledge, skills attitude and competency because this education is a inheritance that cannot be taken away from us stupid."

You&#39;re correct BUT is it necessary to put there &quot;Why Filipinos shoudn&#39;t go to college&quot; like you&#39;re making fun of filipinos.
"Yup. Happened to me. I&#39;m a graphic designer. Went to college as an I.T., and what really hooked me at first was web page designing. The instructors were sing my web page samples to show it to the freshmen. But the thing is, they didn&#39;t taught me enough of the codes, I learned it mostly from the internet. Then later on, I got in on Photoshop. And from there, they weren&#39;t also teaching me enough, and I also learned more from the internet. Tsk!... Now, I&#39;m a freelance graphic designer. More on t-shirt designing, that is. And I love what I&#39;m doing. ‚ù§"

"While I agree with some of your points, it&#39;s not very good not to go to college and there are some flaws in your argument.<br><br>First of all, I think most of you would agree that college degrees are almost a necessity. Companies first look at the candidates&#39; resume to see if they have college degrees. <br><br>If you look at job postings, you can see that almost all postings require a degree. While it&#39;s true that you don&#39;t necessarily need a degree to acquire the skill set you want, most companies look for people who attained higher education than high school. It&#39;s better to have a degree than none at all.<br><br>Second point, your examples (the people who succeeded without college degrees) are NOT the majority. Most who didn&#39;t have a degree are struggling to find jobs or even set up a business (reasons: financial illiteracy, lack of capital, etc). Even Bill Gates himself, a college dropout, suggested to others not to be like him. Especially in today&#39;s economy, college degrees are necessity. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/bill-gates-college-dropout-dont-be-like-me.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/upshot/bill-gates-college-dropout-dont-be-like-me.html</a>"

Lynda ain&#39;t free tho haha
This is so goddamn accurate. My mother knew this already but realised it for a fact when my sister studied at an expensive school but is struggling to find a good paying job at the moment. That‚Äôs why me and my mom decided that I am not going to college and waste my time there. I‚Äôll rather start a small business and have money everyday than being sleepless every night studying something that‚Äôll rarely help me in my everyday life
you clearly dont understand how society works in our country. dont get a college degree. then your resume will always be put on the very last. get a college degree especially on premium colleges and universities and your resume will be first. im good with the idea of pursuing ones own passion though. you just need to study our culture to understand more before doing a video. 1980 and 1990 is  different from 2000 onwards
Then A Filipino guy uploaded a video called &quot;Why AMERICANS Should NOT Go To College&quot;
"I am actually really interested in learning different languages, but unfortunately, in my place, there&#39;s no one who teaches foreign language. Any language is okay to me, I&#39;m very willing to do so. And I&#39;m financially unstable, yet I go to college cause my sister wants me to."
Bat di ikaw mag college
"I get the sentiment you&#39;re trying to get across and I kinda agree with it, but with respect, almost none of what you said can be applied to the lives the majority of Filipinos live"
As a software developer I find this quite true hahaha
not true I&#39;m a Filipino ako ay isang pilipino we Filipinos go to college
WTF im a nurse and at first I was againts this ideology up until I finished the video... It makes sense thank you for sharing. A big thumbs up for me.
"I‚Äôm sorry. but going to college is really important. except if you really dont have money. Filipinos are smart tbh. Big waste of a time? Did you even went to college? Lucky for you. All Filipinos are working hard for them to learn. They just wanna finish their school. I‚Äôm not complaining. But really, college helps you for your future life. Collge degree not valuable? wow! All people do not have jobs and gadgets just to learn in the internet. All of this are just my opinions. I just wish you the best. Cause all of us are trying our best just to finish our studies. No matter how hard."
Parang sinasabi ata nito parang d ako makaka collage  a
;(
Im a filipino
That isn&#39;t true
I am sorry mr munzio but I think you need to research more on the socio political and financial climate in the philippines.  There has been an existing policy for free tuition in state colleges and universities. The reality is that a college degree is a must for a person to have a stable job here in the philippines.  Despite the encouraging anecdotes the majority of filipinos are not as lucky as your friend.  Challenge for you- pick 10 random Filipinos without a college diploma and let them interview in a big company.  The standards you present are those of your country which in all honesty will provide for you despite whatever skills you have.  Not the same for us specifically in the philippines.
This is great and correct üòç but the sad thing is we need a diploma to have a decent job here in the Philippines. üò¢ We play safe to survive rather than to win. I hope this will reach a lot of people to change their perception in life. Thanks üíñ
Pero Gusto Ko Parin Ehh
I agree
because you ended up going to ricefield
I think it is much better that you are learning in school and at the same time you practice it. I agree when you said this words &quot;Most jobs are need skills&quot; yeah it&#39;s true but all of us shall learn something that the outside cannot teach you. Because right now I am studying Major in Broadcast Production in my school Teachers teach us and at the same time we practice it. For me it is better to learn and at the same time you practice it.
"Good points there. I do agree that anybody can have a high paying job even if one didn&#39;t go to college. However, let&#39;s also consider that education in the Philippines is far different from the US&#39; or other countries, especially in high school. I believe in the US, high school students are given vocational lessons, such as how to fix cars, heck, even driving lessons are taught in school inother countries, whereas here in the Philippines, at least back then, it&#39;s all books about general science or history, you know, no real application when it comes to everyday life, except english, i guess. I guess my point is when Filipinos graduate high school before the k-12 program, they were not given skill sets yet, and college was one of the solutions to that. That is also why i agree with the K-12 program because vocations and certain skillsets are incorporated in the senior high school and if this educational system continues in the Philippines, then yeah, i would totally agree with your point. As a speaker myself, whenever i have a talk in front of students, i always encourage them to attend seminars or skills training while they&#39;re young, and always improve on their hobbies or skills and their grasp of the english language, and i would always recommend downloading free e-learning apps and duolingo...<br><br>Anyway, ive said too much already, great video and more videos to come please!!! üòÑ"
Your rung colleg is great
"If it&#39;s free why not? It&#39;s better than having no degree.... Here in USA dont need that as long as you have skills, inborn intellectual but not all have that. You need to go to college to learn. No brainer"
That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing right now :D I am graduating as Engineering students but I managed to earn some few bucks around 10k+ :D Thanks for this video :D My parents is so happy for what I have right now.
"Hello, I‚Äôm a senior high school student who is going to be entering college this year. I have been told by my parents and peers that education is the key to success in life. Getting a degree from scholastic institutions would provide more opportunities for me in the future, generating income and give service to those who need it. <br><br>I remember this conversation I had with my adviser about school and life in general, I told her ‚ÄúGoing to school is so tiresome, I just really wanna quit now.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúLearning is fun when you learn the things you love. I, as a teacher studying my masters won‚Äôt give up learning anytime soon. As I do my job as a teacher, I will continue going to school for as long as I live.‚Äù That line really got me. Its not about earning a degree alone, its about intaking new ideas, concepts, learnings, and the like to keep the mind active and fresh. <br><br>I do agree that some jobs don‚Äôt need a college degree but one shouldn‚Äôt be discouraging education. It is our basic right,  a tool in which it can break us free from ignorance. <br><br>My parents were born poor, and when I say poor I mean REALLY poor. My father‚Äôs father had to work hard each and everyday to provide for my 9 aunts and uncles including my father as a public school principal. My father pursued what he wanted which was accounting then law, contradictory to what my grandfather wanted which was education (he wanted my dad to be a teacher). When choosing a degree, make sure its something you see yourself doing for the rest of your life, and if not most of it."
I couldn;t agree more!!!
Ok guys dont go to collage
"Sad reality: Employers here in the Philippines are more likely to judge their employees according to their educational attainment without even assessing the skills they possess (Or at least that&#39;s why my parents told me).<br>I do believe the idea man, I know many men, my cousins to be precise, flunk off college, yet the greatest successors in our family. Hopefully I would become successful and satisfied in the near future without serving the purpose only to meet my parent&#39;s expectations. Thumbs up to the video by the way, it&#39;s motivational. Greatest of appreciations from me =)"
"I&#39;m a BSHRM graduate..but...the truth is i only want to become a singer, a performer..it&#39;s depressing thinking about the wasted years of my life without doing something i really want..anyway,thank you for this vid David..‚ù§"
Oh my god thank you so much for making this video! I&#39;m a fil-chi senior high student who is currently struggling and stressed out on deciding a course for college. I don&#39;t know if my family will accept the idea of me not going to college but this video opened my eyes and I truly thank you. The title of this video really caught my interest since I really needed this kind of answer.
Thanks now i wont go to college..
"There are people who are gifted with talents. I graduated as a BSN and frankly I am content with it. College had gave me a specific skill set that I proudly use in my work. Interacting with people. Most of people who really knew me will tell you that I am a quiet and reserved person. But when outside my home others will tell you that I am a friendly person who will talk your ears off and also very approachable. The skill to socialize with my patients blossomed when I was in college. So I must say I dont agree with you saying that it is a waste of time. <br>If you really love what you are doing, is learning about it a waste of time? For example, if I love to draw. I would think of going to college to learn the Fine Arts course. I would want to learn more about it because I love it. And I&#39;m learning through professionals who are doing this for a long time. Their teaching will make me better. <br>Also about finding a skill set. To be honest that is ridiculously hard to find. What we love doesnt equate to our skills. Truthfully I love to make EDM but I am really bad at it. The improvement is slow as I have no one to teach me and only looking up in videos are not helpful. But if I had someone to help me understand better, it would be much faster. Skills are honed through repetition and careful guidance. It always make me think of apprenticeship programs. If only we can implement it...<br>Anyway, I love how you point out your dislike about colleges and I can see in the future that once we meet, we can have a meaningful and intellectual conversation."
I strongly agree
DONT RUIN MAH DREAMS M8
Joke But its True :)
"I didnt like it why he just pointed filipino when its said philippines are more on education and stuff, but i do agree on his statement"
ok
"I do get your point, but not everyone is as lucky as some are. Some may not need to go to college and yet ended up successfully because they have skill and fate on favor. But for some, they are still finding that skillset that you are saying, maybe in college. Plus, it depends on the person because a lot in the Philippines wants to go to college because they want to have a degree. Something to say to the society and their <a href=""http://family.so/"">family.So</a> how can you say such that we don&#39;t need to go to college and  just do some online research? I am not being mean, just saying."
How can we get good jobs
"Yes, I strongly agree with you Mr. David. But I guess it really depends on the determination of the person and how they are eager to learn more about their passion or hobby. We can become successful whether we have a college degree or not. One way is by applying to simple jobs which doesn&#39;t require any degrees and from there we&#39;re going to learn anything(e.g skills) including the products of the business and also its concepts and later if we&#39;re ready to create/build a business, we&#39;re just going to improve the product(whatever the product or concept the business had) to make it more unique for our own business.<br><br>This is what I&#39;ve realized years ago, everything in this world is very useful to us. How? If you know how to put an importance to something and you know how to make something that could be of great use to everybody. This only requires creativity. ;) I&#39;ve realized this because I&#39;m a disabled person and most of us will be treated differently by most of the normal people. And that&#39;s when I also realized that sometimes people who are different can also make big differences through his own talent or skill - if only we know how to make ourselves important to anyone or any business and how to make everybody important to us. <br><br>And another thing, if you&#39;re the creator of something then you have the power to improve it more because of the things you have learned while building that something. <br><br>What I also realized if I did go to school years ago is that my learning would only be limited to what your course or the school wants you to learn so that means you can only focus to one specific job.<br><br>Great video Mr. David!<br>Thanks for this.<br><br>Harold here from Cebu. ;)"
Only got to 4 mins to the video and as a filipino i agree
"I&#39;m not that old and neither am i in College, and of course i&#39;m still going to question things, such as people telling me that i might need to have proof of attending college or university to get into certain bigger or more ambitious companies, even though i personally think that&#39;s unnecessary if that person is more than qualified, i guess it&#39;s a necessity. <br>But i am indeed concerned that i might not use my college degree, that&#39;s why i&#39;m thinking of pursuing Arts or Computer Programming, but i am still debating the use of those 4+ years and lotsss of money compared to what i&#39;ve learned right now from the internet, trial and error, and just simply learning.<br>I have seen lots of people advising to get a degree, to finish College, attend a university, but honestly if i&#39;m not going to put those several years to use, i might as well not attend at all except for that fact that i need it as &quot;they&#39;ve&quot; said, But of course, i will learn the truth towards my problem here once i actually encounter it in person."
"But if you have the Degree and Skills that would be much better, Right?<br>Great Video David!"
You are idiot bro
1k ppl disagreeing didn&#39;t get the point of this vi
Sino filipino dito??üòÇüòÇ
"I adore you and I really like the way you put things and understandings into words. But, I shouldn&#39;t encourage people to NOT to go to College. I mean, most of jobs require their workers to finish their study until college. Requiring college degree, so yep. Maybe some people can work it out without being in college, yet there are some who can&#39;t. Yeah, just sharing my thoughts. X"
not all of the filipino wantto go in collage tats not true
Um filipinos go to college I&#39;ve heard it from a lot of my friends because when I watched this thing I questioned my friends like hey do filipinos go to college and alot of people say to me YEEEESSS ARE YOU DUMB but for real because I&#39;m a filipino like kamusta mga kabatian...
Exactly!! A degree won&#39;t determine how great of a person you&#39;ll be.
"i agree! we all have a choice! :) but going to college here in the Philippines was really awesome the experience, meeting different talented especially kind  and skilled people makes me learned a lot about my world! i just don&#39;t like to be ignorant and i don&#39;t want to have only one or two skills because i don&#39;t want to limit myself i want to challenge myself more with these bunch of A class students in my Umiversity :) my teacher said you can&#39;t ever replaced a teacher with technologies tho but yesss i hate my school and the word &quot;degrees&quot;! it&#39;s depressing :)"
"I love this video, I really don&#39;t want to go college. I start to my own business when Im at high school, I hate schools. Since I was a kid, I know I didn&#39;t need college. &#39;cause I have my Own talent and skills to earn how to. And I know Youtube is one of the best school online and its free!"
I would love to be good fixing cars or rebuild one and At the same time be good at my Course.
its free if your from a public school thats what i heard idk if its true or not fyi
"I&#39;m in 11th grade and I&#39;m really hesitant to go to college. My parents want me to be an engineer because of my mathematical skills. My father is an engineer too. But I want to be a writer, and that isn&#39;t exactly an ideal career in any country. I&#39;m also at a disadvantage since I can&#39;t speak Tagalog fluently. I also have a dream of being an artist, again not an ideal career. I am fairly good at art though."
Well I dont know anything about college but you know i still wanna go to college since i love sports yeah..... and i dont have skills i cant even flip pancakes
"Woah! Should I say your view is bombastic? Wow. Good job, David."
I would go to college  in states...
This is why PewDiePie didn&#39;t continue college :)
Should NOT Go To College. SAD
Well tell that to the employer.. :D :D :D
"How can a non-Filipino citizen advising Filipinos NOT to go to college??? Are you even aware of the situation in our country? There is nothing wrong going to College or getting a degree, it makes you more qualified. If you think that you have a degree but then lack of skills, then enroll yourself to a certain vocational school, at least you have a degree and you have skills at the same time. Having a degree is like securing yourself in the future. So dont you dare tell us, NOT to go the college. Why dont you mind your own yard?"
"Hey David, you make some good points. It is the skills that matter more. However, I would not say why Filipinos should NOT go to college, but perhaps why Filipinos should NOT NECESSARILY go to college. Just like you said, certain professions would require you to have both a degree AND skills. I was born, raised, and got my first degree from the Philippines, and my second degree from the UK. I became a teacher and you know what, that also landed me a job in the US. Without a degree, no school would entrust me to teach their students. Of course like you said I also needed the skill, so I also had to go to a US college to acquire more skills and get certified or I will have to switch careers. I currently teach at a public school in the Atlanta area because of my college degrees. For other professions yes it may not be the same case. <br><br>Likewise, being successful doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to earning big bucks. True, it is a very important aspect of anyone&#39;s financial goal, but for some people, the fulfillment of being in their profession of choice is more of a priority. Thus, even if those high paying jobs that don&#39;t require a college degree but require specialty skills may sound like a better option, other people may consider certain careers of their choice that do require a college degree more of a priority, whether or not they do get paid a lot. Using my profession again as an example, we don&#39;t get paid as much as many other professionals like doctors or laywers, but it is more of a calling.<br><br>So in my opinion, it is not so much about whether or not you need a college degree, but more on what your calling is. If what you want to do in life doesn&#39;t really require a college degree, then focus on building specialized skills and you will be successful. If you are the academic type who wants to get a career on certain fields, then by all means, get a college degree."
i agree
what do u know?.. i mean we like to waste time money and effort despite poverty. and having a degree seems like a trend here.. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Cool.I&#39;m a Filipino and that was so truelalo
u can get a degree with a certain skill but a degree cant get a the skill for a certain job
"I respect your opinion ... But you should not encourage us Filipino&#39;s not to go to college. Because not all of us is like you, or has the same mind set that you have.... P.s Bill Gates went to harvard but did not finish because he wanted to start a business and make money.... Bill gates went to college ..."
"What he means about the word &quot;College&quot; was required a DEGREE in able for you to practice and earn money <br> (Medical, Legal, Finance, or any field that requires to be LICENSED). One of the best example here is Derren Brown one of the most popular Illusionist in UK. He graduated Law school, but pursue his passion to Illusion, Magic, and Showmanship. Rick Lax is also a Magician that was so close to become a Lawyer as well. Lots of people became more successful in the career path that based on their PASSION than based on their education. People here in the Philippines are often influenced to get a good education, finish a degree in college, get a stable JOB, and save finances. No one realized that there&#39;s a GLASS CEILING on this kind of thinking, and this what makes people live a mediocre life. I do, website design, online marketing, I do play guitar, do some magic, and I actually made an earnings on it... and I don&#39;t even reach the second year of the 2 year course that I take. I just tried to learn a thing, make an earning out of it, and thats it! Its not an excuse that you can&#39;t get successful at something because you don&#39;t make it out of your education. If you don&#39;t pursue something that you believe that makes a good fortune for you, you will surely work for them and make a good fortune for them!"
apparently skilled jobs does not pay well in the phillippines employers still need people who goes to collage
Im filipino fuck it
"Not all degree holders can get their jobs in the Philippines, its only those who proved themselves to become professionals for example passing their own respective board exams before becoming a professional, graduating college in the ph does not mean you can finally get your profession, there is a board exam you need to pass before becoming professional.<br><br>if not going to college, maybe your advice is a good thing if all you need is just small amount of money even if its not stable but when you need a stable job and easy big money without deduction then the best thing here in the Philippines is to graduate college and pass their board exams, for them to work in the government, easy money, big money, no hassle work, simple living, no overtime, no more sacrifices.<br><br>the tax reform law here is a big problem to those who just works with their own skills without going to college, the government here increased the salaries of police, soldiers, and any other employees working in the government, but the main issue here is that, the food in the market here is also increasing its value sale, only those who works in the government are the ones who can buy the food in the market without sacrifices, and this is the main reason why the president here made college for free and the main reason why people in the Philippines should go to college, not just going to college but getting a 4 year college degree possible, studying in college here is very important."
We go to college because we learn what the successful. Peoples/person and their Contribution to use Them to apply them to upgrade it to surpass the successful ones because after that they will look just another stepping stone person who created something for us to Surpass it...<br>What ever skills you have is not enough.. you end up to the same spot you started you would never grow higher..<br>Like the plant with no soil nor water or sunlight...<br>You stood still until the base collapsed.. <br>Your fame Will End.. REMEMBER
"FIY:some of us are not poor <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo3As36trkA&amp;t=1m45s"">1:45</a>"
"I don&#39;t know why being a college graduate is mandatory there to get a job, even graduated in a popular universities like UP and UST. For me skills are the most important, also your passion in that field that you can contribute to the company. What&#39;s the sense of graduating college with degree if your lacking skills??"
"So true. My family forces me to pursue Accountancy, which is not my passion. Because of that, I always get a failing grade. They will always scold me for that even my relatives. They were like ‚ÄúYou wont get a decent job if you don‚Äôt study hard.‚Äù Because of my failing grades, I shifted my course to Industrial Engineering. Yes, you could say that I can ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the course but, it felt like something was missing. Art is my passion. I wish to express what I am feeling right now through my drawings. Seriously though, why is there a you-should-get-a-degree-to-get-a-decent-job-mindset in my family?<br>BTW, this video is inspiring. Thank you so much!"
"I will honestly say this, I know A LOT of undergrads and I have yet to go into college since I&#39;m a scholar of the Philippines training to be one of the leaders in Science and Technology(which you have pointed out, needs a degree but today it&#39;s not about me). It is EXTREMELY HARD to get a good job in the Philippines as an undergrad. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, it&#39;s just really hard. Yes, I will acknowledge that you have your own points BUT a ton of employers will look for a degree. Yes, I am still a minor but what I&#39;m spewing out are the experiences of some people I know."
"Yeah that&#39;s true i&#39;ve noticed too I&#39;ve known people who doesn&#39;t go to college is  more talented   and real skills indeed,and the people who has a degree most likely used to become dragged others"
"I have to agree, I only entered college for the Computer Sciences. The Philippine colleges must only for jobs that needs a degree. That is why I have two choices, be a Self-sufficient and Self-employed programmer(since Colleges are something I regret). My Skill Set never met with IT, but I chose to go for game devs, but mostly I would be like a Carpenter or an Architect. But you know, I chose the earlier option.<br><br>Thats all."

Racy...
I&#39;m currently gr. 10 and I&#39;m pursuing to be a digital artist any tips or ideas? I mean do I have to prepare something? What should I do after I finish senior high? Can someone give me an idea?
"A college degree is relevant for people who walk the slow and steady path. I am such a type and i know i wouldnt have gotten to where i am now without education. I think we need to be careful with these types of videos. Kids might use this as an excuse to not study.  Not everyone is blessed with such a clear vision so early in life.  And we also need to understand that only a fraction makes it to success. I have seen far too many tambays in my days.  Very insightful video though, but to all the kids listening to this. Study hard."
It&#39;s hard. Im poor.
Hey I&#39;m a Filipino and I&#39;m only grade 4 and I think we need a complete education and my friends family and people in my village and city
But but my tita(aka aunti) goes to college so she can be a midwife
"No man. Philippines is a poor country, it&#39;s not like america where there&#39;s alot of opportunities. Even college grads have a hard time finding jobs. And i think being a plumber or a carpenter wouldn&#39;t do you good these days. We&#39;re bound to be jobless or &quot;tambay&quot; unless we&#39;re dedicated to put in the work. Don&#39;t forget that mentality of the filipinos."
"Im a filipino,, My  filipino-american cousin is in college right now studying in United-States."
"Pilipino, not filipino, <br>Pilipino means pinoy/pinay or philippines citizens, filipino means tagalog or pilipino language or philippines main language..."
"This is an assessment of a materialistic and pragmatic degree. Not every Filipino goes to school so they could have a solid bank account. In that case, quit college and build a business or craft instead. Filipino colleges are also venues for learning; academic, social and in-practice experiences. The problem here is materialism, not the want for further learning in a specific field."
"Fuck diploma....make some videos, post in youtube, get rich...<br>Or...<br>Study hard, Workd hard, have a great high paying job, have a chance to get fired/broken company, have a chance of bankrupt, bad future"
this video should have titled about Asian parents not just filipinos..
"A lot of my college graduate friends finds hard time looking for a job because of high standards. Good thing, the government added 2 more years in highschool with educational strands to be followed by the students. I am an undergraduate and currently working in BPO industry for 3 years now and I&#39;m happily earning pretty well. I would still love to get a bachelor&#39;s degree since my parents never had it before and the least I can do is to make their dream come true."
"You dont live here at PH so stop thinking you understand us, skills is indedd necessary but in PH even if you have skills its not use if you arent a college degree holder because companies wont accept you and thats how it goes here"
"Keep this in mind mister your country is diff. To us dont encourage more filipino to not study because thats the reason why we have poverty, and whats wrong about going to college ? Whats wrong about learning ? We filipino are used on hardship, maybe you are not that is why you are so afraid to go to college"
"I really think you misunderstood us... We Filipinos are swords that are just sheathed...  Every individual in our country will only be skillful if they will study... Yes we have the internet but education about your career is just the step... You also need social life... Without the college... You&#39;ll miss the opportunity to learn every aspect of every person that exists... Here in the Philippines... Everything is practical... Without education, you won&#39;t get a job... Without a job, you won&#39;t earn money... Without money, You will starve to death... And remember this... &quot;Di natatapos ang edukasyon sa paaralan&quot; in english, Education doesn&#39;t and at school... That&#39;s what my grandma use to tell me every time I tell her what you are telling us right now... So go to college bro... Have a life... Unless you only want to be a public figure just to earn money... I would prefer a life with privacy..."
"Its not like we wanted to go in college aswell, maybe on your country you dont have to go to college in order ro get a high paid job but here in PH most of the time company do not accept employee that isnt  a college degree holder so tell me how can  we get a job that can support our family when no company wanted to accept us ?<br>Its easy to say for you because you dont live here you dont know the struggles of our people in order to get a job"
i agree im a filipino kid who doesnt want to go to college and high school but i need too.
My dad doesn&#39;t have a college degree but he has carried us to success by being a contractor. He have skills in engineering and he uses it very well without a degree on it.

"Akoy isang filipino, and i learned something in this video. That we people have our own hidden skills. Salamat pre"
are u stupid how are we going to get good jobs when we dont get to collage
"this is what i&#39;m talking about! i didn&#39;t finish my computer science course that said i can earn with basic salary minimum of Php350/8hrs in a company. i got bored and tired going to school that time then i saw my school mate looked very happy and excitedly  printing lectures, images and researches in a computer shop where i worked before. i greeted him and asked how you doin and why you looked so excited? he answered that he just finished a short massage therapy course/training and he just earned Php300 in an hour. so i took the training and passed the Philippine Department of Health Licensure Exam and TESDA Massage Therapy NC II and now im undergoing TESDA&#39;s Trainers Methodology to be an Official Trainer/Assessor for Massage Therapy NC II. now im earning more than a company could offer."
I&#39;m Filipino<br>...wt-<br><br><br><br>Thank you :)
1k narrow-minded peenoise
I agree with you but i think my parents wouldn&#39;t agree if i didn&#39;t go to college.
"Huh... As a Filipino, I find this to be very interesting input. Subbed to see more of this type of content and whatever else there is.<br><br>And yes, I completely agree. What&#39;s the point of 100&#39;s and diplomas when they can&#39;t even do basic household chores like sweeping, washing clothes and dishes, gardening, etc?"
"YOU KNOW WHAT?!! NOT ALL PEOPLE HAVE THAT MIND SET. IF YOU ARE NOT A COLLEGE GRADUATE HERE, ITS HARD TO FIND A JOB! JUST FOR EXAMPLE, THERES THIS &quot;HIRING COMPUTER ATTENTANT, MUST BE AN IT COLLEGE LEVEL OR COLLEGE GRADUATE&quot; RIGHT?? AND YEAH, EVEN THOU YOU KNOW HOW TO USE COMPUTERS DEFENITELY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HIRE YOU IF YOU&#39;RE ONLY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. SO, DONT TELL US THAT US, FILIPINOS SHOULD NOT GO IN COLLEGE."
Nah!!! 50/50 right and wrong.
"I still want to get my doctorate degree someday not because of money but because I love what I&#39;m doing.I also don&#39;t want to waste my parent&#39;s money and efforts just to sent me in a university.It&#39;s just the matter of taking the risk and <a href=""http://struggles.my/"">struggles.My</a> parents are not from rich families but they are able to sent me in a private catholic school and now in a university because they struggle to get their college degree and find good jobs with enough salary to supply our needs.<br>Even if I really love sports I still chose to continue studying.I sacrificed my varsity life during highschool and focused on my studies."
I want to collage because i want to be pilot i want 100k pesos every trip
im phillipino
"I agree with you. Spending 4 years in college just to get a paper called diploma. It&#39;s like wasting 4 years of your life. Though, we really need it to get a good job. Though, I admire you. 100% agreeing with you"
"Well I always wanted to do a book, but because of school it&#39;s hard to do so with so many freakin&#39; work. I also want to create documentaries and all of does good stuff, but school doesn&#39;t teach me, so I taught myself and I&#39;m still a rookie, but hey i&#39;ts a start"
College is still dangerous anyway.
"It make sense now, thanks but in Philippines, k to 12 is now been followed. Do we still need to go college even if it is useless?"
You stupid! We filipino does college!
dislikers are close-minded
My grandfather did not go to collage
"I&#39;d also like to respect your opinion,but me with my lingering opinion is here, first, let&#39;s talk about the filipino&#39;s alone, <br>Giving Youtube, Lynda as a legitimate source to learn? That really isn&#39;t the greatest thing because not everything is true in the internet, and this just  another problem for them, to access this with a great poverty and illiterate count.<br><br>            I believe what you&#39;re saying about the ph is wrong, the fact that the problem is there are too many people with college degrees, and it&#39;s not only the people&#39;s fault, but society and the government itself, because we are facing what we call the &quot;brain drain&quot; those with what we call high experienced people are leaving the country, leaving the country which poses a threat.<br>           <br>           If we were to encourage this(master an element), to mass amounts, just think about it, would it not be something more in vain because there would be too many people in that course one can learn for himself? Which also drags others down only leaving the true greatest at the top? To be able to provide to something... one needs a true stable one, not like what you&#39;re saying, no one could tell if you would just suddenly drop out of youtube, thus you can&#39;t make a house without materials in the first place?!<br><br>         Just because those other people did it means we can do it again, nothing ever happens exactly again. Everyone has their own circumstances. People can&#39;t just walk into a company and say ill work for free and get accepted, that was the PAST. While with connections, not everyone has those.<br><br> It should not be the matter of as to why filipinos SHOULD Not be going to college, but as to How people should mind their own business, jk , as if i&#39;m someone to say that, but anyways... it&#39;s about the problem of humanity itself if i must say so, im gettin lazy and tired, go ez on me people, hatahs gonna hate, but srsly, this is only  my honest opinion and you can disagree with it, i&#39;m sorry if there was wrong grammar or spelling.<br>Freshy here."
Yes... We shouldn&#39;t...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>CUZ WE TO SMART!!!</b>
Only skill I&#39;m good at is masturbation. :/ So I guess college is my only way to success :(
Well said..
"Your right! My parent and my auntie taking me course that i dont like. I want fine arts but they refuse it and always saying what kind of job you will get?? They always saying if you have degree like law, i will got great life. It&#39;s too damn on my family, i love them but they dont see were i could find my happiness.. And now i didnt finish the degree, but still i have great job as semi conductor!"
This dude doesn&#39;t understand Filipino society.  It&#39;s worth to go to collage in the Philippines even if it&#39;s worthless because it will elevate them to a high class.  The Philippines is a rigid class based society almost like a cast system and having a worthless college diploma is is very useful for moving up .
"I do not agree because your information are sketchy. You only give so few information. Even you are saying that internet can help, in shantytowns for example so many of them do not even have access to internet nor can afford books. You are talking about a few of them billionaire. What about the 99% of the world&#39;s population. No access to internet and everything. For example medical practicioners are on a shortage. Are you saying juat read a book you can become engineer or technician. There are a lot of college graduates who became millionaire. Here in the philippines there is Manny Villar, Manny Pangilinan, Lucio Tan, Henry Sy. You are only saying it maybe because you hate studying. Most highly paid individuals here in the philippines are college graduate. Recently President Durerte raised the salary of our police and military. To get into police force either you graduate a degree in Philippine National Police Academy which is by the way a degree course or a comissioned officer, college graduate and enlist to become a police or military personnel. Many americans who work in these companies who hold positions have degrees. Many professors in american universities especially nobel laurette whose salary is sky high is not only a degree holder but a doctorate. You cannot become a teacher or a professor without a degree."
"The title was misleading for me, but the content was great"
"Well even you do have a point, but its too hard to get a job with out having a degree. Without a degree it would be harder to get a job more likely in the philippines. Also parents in the Philippines believe that going to college is the best gift they could give to their child so not going to college would likely be harder."
"I went for college in this past 3 years, and i feel good in my first year but the last 2 i am lost. I got tired, luckily my mom got an idea for me to have a online business and thats when i said to my mom i dont wanna go to college anymore and im glad she just said OK then, no but and why, and now im learning my own way using internet i mean anything i want to learn, now im learning korean language in my own way, i have my own time and i made my own schedule, getting a stable money from the online business, im still in a long way but i wish myself goodluck"

"I graduated to college but I totally agree. Very well said, David. A big thumbs up!!!"
you shouldn&#39;t say this many filipino students strive to finish college even their parents dont want them
Elon Musk is a dropped out too. ^_^
Im a commerce grad and love fixing computers. Now im learning HTML for additional skills. hehe. Great vid David. ^_^
"It is nice not to go to college and just be an entertainer or celeb or be an inventor of some technologies like bill gates but, I dont want to disappoint my father he always want to see me at the stage receiving my diploma and asuring that I will have a better life and by the way collge life is fun like the acceptance party it was very fun and I have a dream to be a nuclear engeneer,even the studies makes you crazy almost give up of life when you didn&#39;t passed a course but,I know my father and family is always by my side to encourage me,All I want is to make father proud by recieving a diploma at the end of my last school year,even if I become a successful inventor or entertainer,ofcourse he will still be proud but,the feeling is different to what he expect me to be come<br><br>P.S. I also want to buy my father a &quot;hacienda&quot; so when he grew old and retire he said he will grow vegetables,but I think he wont last longer on that place because he loves to travel and maybe spending the money from his benefits he recieve on a world tour with mother"
I agree with your opinion :)
I respect you if you dont want to go to college but try to think about those parents who really wanted their child to finish college. here in the philippines it is the parents achievement that they have a child who finished college because despite from all the challenges they still work hard for their children to go to college. In one side I believe in you but in the other I go with what most of the parents would do. This helps.
very true
"Ideally that is true. In your case, Skills are more important than degrees to your country. But we Filipino need some kind of title or certificate or deploma whatever it is to be qualified for a job. And that is reality. We can&#39;t just go to some companies and offer a free service for them. For sure they won&#39;t accept that kind of  proposal or they also might think that you are crazy by doing that. Because all of the companies here in the Philippines are very demanding when it comes to hiring people. Proving your self won&#39;t be enough. They need the pieces of paper called certificate/deploma or the alphanumeric characters called license for you to be qualified and accepted for a job. If you don&#39;t have those things you will end up being a driver , maid, fastfood crew, janitor or cleaner. But some people here made their own fortune and become successful even though without getting any degree from college. Some became successful business man. Some goes to abroad and use their skills to work. But then again if you are looking for a corporate job here in PH. You need to go in college no matter what."
Hey. ..
Finish high school.<br>Get a trade.<br>Don&#39;t have kids out of wedlock.<br>That&#39;s it. You&#39;re set. I&#39;m an education major and I&#39;m telling you that college is not necessary.
"The major Philippine universities (The &quot;Ivy League&quot; composed of UP, AdMu, UST, and DLSU) are all just brown copies of the liberal-infested US unis.<br>Anything that the shitlib American unis do, the Filipino &quot;Ivy League&quot; -ers will surely imitate.<br><br><b>Still, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s advisable for Filipinos to forego college.</b><br>Kids can still weave through the liberal indoctrination for as long as they are warned and given the lowdown by people who have been through the gauntlet.<br>While the quality of education may pale in comparison to its more developed neighbors (Japan, SK, Singa, even Malaysia), we are talking about acquiring skills here that the country can use in order to progress.<br>The basic essentials of engineering, architecture, the sciences, agriculture, health, etc can churn out graduates who can help the country. We just have to tell the kids of one simple fact of Filipino life: <b>We will never move forward as a nation if we keep migrating to more developed nations.</b><br>Getting experience (or further education) from more developed nations can help us, but only if we decide to apply what we learned and experience here.<br>You see, the developed nations have their own problems (illegal immigration, being forced to agree to ridiculous terms authored by supranational bodies, lethargy of the native population due to their governments prioritizing illegals immigrants, etc.) and we can&#39;t move forward if we keep forcing developed nations t hold our hands while we cross the street or something.<br><br>The current problem of the major Philippine unis is not that they can;t provide the student with skills and knowledge required for him/her to be a productive member of society.<br>The problem is that the major Philippine unis, like most liberal unis in the Western world, have become leftist indoctrination camps where students are being turned into &quot;smart&quot; zombies, ready to carry out the agenda of whoever is sponsoring the uni they&#39;re in."
"what are you trying to freak children out of school. Actually your discouraging children to study, Well. your right it&#39;s really a waste of energy if you go to college that&#39;s true but think about the amount of lessons and those learning&#39;s you&#39;ll get from it. People need life experience going to college means your fulfilling your goal bc you cannot actually say that you &quot;Graduated&quot; if you didn&#39;t go to college that&#39;s why college is so important!!!"
i dont plan to go in college &lt;3
"I dont think so, Going to collage means you are desparate to enhance your mind and sometimes you just need a fresh start in life, You need to put away your old habits and your old self, and become the person you were meant to be. That may sound cheesy, but I‚Äôve found it to be true of  other people I know. It is especially the case for young people who are transitioning from childhood to adulthood. College is the perfect opportunity to break out of that old shell and become someone totally new. I know what are you talking about, i respect you, but this is inspiring students to not go to collage, collage is an great opportunity to get involved in politics, be a journalist and be anything you want to be. <br>This video is just wasting other people&#39;s time.<br><br>EDIT: It does not mean that  &quot;successful and historic people didn&#39;t go to collage&quot; Does that mean that you dont have to go to collage? They didn&#39;t go because they have financial problems to go to collage, Now that collages are free, there are big opportunities to study and fulfil what you want to be!"
Bakit filipino ako
"In the Philippines Even though you&#39;ve got a lot of skills and a college degree plus post graduate title, Filipino employers still ask for more, depending on what the business organization is? the type of job the applicant is applying for a specific position, or how big or great the name of the company with respect to applicants credentials and working background. Which employer from other countries don&#39;t. Foreign employers don&#39;t just hire us for some specific skills that is needed for the job qualification but the other qualities we have as an applicant. That&#39;s why many Filipinos are highly in demand abroad. I do not say all, but most of Filipino employers in our country don&#39;t know how to spot our skill. Many Good Filipinos with no degree become successful entrepreneur become rich and give opportunities to others. While in our government, we still hearing repeatedly that the cause of unemployment is job mismatch which is definitely untrue. The real caused is many Filipinos negative attitude called false judgement to other things &quot;mapanghusga&quot; envy &quot;pagkainggit&quot; and greed &quot;pagkasakim&quot; resulting for them to choose jobs which don&#39;t really apply to their credential and skills and later on become jobless. While on the other side, when this kind of people be on the seat on their dream job, they become arrogant and not allowing others to get hired because they see their potential to get successful career path and they get envious, because of this better people are eliminated and for a whole nation makes a country totally corrupt. College degree is very important and that is not an opinion but a fact. Skills and Knowledge are both important. It plays as an equilibrium on every economic success from a country to other country. The key to success in life is not diploma or owned skills but Working Hard for the glory of GOD."
"I just don&#39;t want to go to college, amirite fellow Pinoys? B)"
prolly gonna treat me as a liability to a family and a shame to my family
Im a filipino but i dont know that filipinos dont go to college .....and thanks like your video im 5
"So you are basically saying that people don&#39;t need to do expensive college when there are vocational jobs. Good point, but<br><br>Yeah, as if you can be an engineer by watching youtube videos. Stop saying people should not go to college and contribute to our brain drain.<br><br>Also the people you linked are brilliant themselves. NOT EVERYONE is as brilliant as them, or can just pop out that brilliant idea that can make them rich. Saying all of colleges are scam is stupid. Colleges are there because they will instill you the knowledge needed for you to become your desired profession. You are paying for the experts to teach you the knowledge you will use for your profession. Colleges and universities are the fronts of research. Why, are you telling me that you can become a surgeon by watching youtube videos from some random schmuck? You can become a licensed doctor by watching videos? A lawyer?<br><br>And there&#39;s one thing he isn&#39;t telling you, that piece of paper that he keeps denigrating has an actual value. You may keep advancing in your career but always your salary will be lower. My father&#39;s job was like that, he was the manager but his salary is lower than others because he doesn&#39;t have a degree. I know someone who works as an engineer who has lower salary and can&#39;t advance on the job because they don&#39;t have a licensce.<br><br>If you are gonna promote vocational education you can do that without saying colleges are shit."
"Most filipinos do not pursue their passion, they get college degrees because they want to play it safe. The chances of being successful in the Philippines is low even if they finish college, what more for those who did not acquire. It is luck and the rare abilities that can make people want you and to be able to support your family, because without it you&#39;ll end in poverty especially with the government who can&#39;t fully support its citizens. Rest assured, I&#39;m not trying to argue, I also want to share my opinion. Anyways, great advice."
this better be good. or if its not..... well.......
O sge wag na jk
"David DiMuzio. I get where you are getting your concept. And all I have to say is, you are right, to a certain extent. <br><br>You see, David. I tried to follow your advice. I searched in youtube and tried to give a shot at learning chemical engineering. I tried to envision myself finishing the course on youtube and learn how to handle chemicals if it kills me. <br><br>But then, something struck me. I realized, even if I would be able to learn all about chemical engineering online for free, I will not be able to use it and make money out of it. Why? Simple. REGULATION. GOVERNMENT AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION.  <br><br>Before you can practice public accountancy, plumber, engineering, chemistry, and the like, you need to have a LICENSE TO PRACTICE THEM! Before you can start a business in being a mechanic, caretaker, plumber, and the like, you need to have a BUSINESS LICENSE TO ENGAGE IN SUCH BUSINESS.<br><br>Before you can get these LICENSES, you need to have that piece of paper called DIPLOMA. Even in some VOCATIONAL COURSES, you need to have that piece of paper that will PROVE you FINISHED THE COURSE.<br><br>You will then need to pass a LICENSURE EXAMINATION for some of them; specifically, engineering, plumber, nursing, accountancy, and mechanic.  They will require you to have a degree before taking the exam. <br><br>If you DARE to practice any of those professions or engage in businesses related to those professions without the PROPER LICENSES AND PAPERS, YOU WILL FACE THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW.<br><br>For example, you DARE to fix someone&#39;s toilet WITHOUT A LICENSE, you could get into trouble. If something goes wrong, you will lose your case and end up in jail. There was a man who pretended to be a dentist. Something went wrong. He got sued; both by the Philippine Dental Association and the Professional Regulations Commission.<br><br>If you try to open up a chemical company of some sort, and you are using unlicensed professionals, the public will not be very accepting of that and the government will be after you.  You will lose your business and be paying heavy fines.<br><br>So yes. Sad it is to admit it, as much as it would benefit me to be a chemist without a license and a degree. THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE WILL NOT THINK SO. I would still need to go to a university, get my grades, get my degree, pass an exam, and get my license. Then would I be allowed to do what you say. <br><br>Maybe your advice applies to unrestricted or yet to be restricted professions, like maybe, carpentry or house cleaning. Maybe it can also apply to computer courses, coding, and clerical jobs.  But in general, businesses and professions are regulated in the country. That&#39;s why we need a college degree.<br><br>Hope this opens up some things. <br><br>Cheers."
Very well said.
"I agree but....we need to go to college to get decent jobs, so we can support our family... im just on 5th grade but i typically understand....nice video though....."
Im going for music so ya im with you
"Most people go to college, because they just need the paper. Learn and forget most people are just there for the diploma for a job"
"Ok, this is an interesting topic. Great video and great points, I just wanna share some opinions I have based on my own personal experience.<br><br>First of all let me give you my background. I&#39;m 23 years old and hold 2 degrees, I also specialize in Animation of all forms, Pre-and Post production for films including Sound Design , and also work as a Graphic designer and Programmer on the side.<br><br>I developed my skillset as I bounced through a busy work schedule in college which helped me train my scheduling and social skills, I further improved it taking my next specialization course which opened up a lot of opportunities for me. My point is, college isn&#39;t entirely useless if you know what you&#39;re doing and approach it differently.<br><br>Now here&#39;s a true story:<br>A good friend of mine who&#39;s several years older than me worked in a really high paying job over in Singapore, when his superior found out he didnt hold a diploma he had to be let go (for god knows what reason), I was in college at the time, he came back to the Philippines to finish his course and ended up becoming my classmate in the process till he graduated. <br><br>Point is, having a degree isn&#39;t much a waste of time as it is a proof of quality (While I do agree not everyone with a degree is equal in skill, it still helps), as much as we hate it in the eyes of the corporate it&#39;s a way of distinguishing talents, but it&#39;s not the only factor in landing a job. The way you speak and conduct yourself in an interview is extremely important, the way you dress, you body language and diction etc, and most important of all your portfolio. <br><br>While yes, famous people such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg etc. have never finished college and went on to become billionaires, that is such a small fraction of the people that have gambled with not having a complete skill set academically, practically and socially. For   every single person that succeeded there are thousands that failed. Don&#39;t rely on a lottery to make it big. Hard work is what matters, but having a degree wont hurt either ;)"
"What bullshit. <br><br>US isn&#39;t the Philippines, what goes in the US doesn&#39;t go in the PH. <br><br>You need a college degree in the PH if you&#39;re gonna have a career. You want to be a security guard? Get a college degree. There&#39;s a reason why parents strive very hard just to put their children in college and that&#39;s to give them a future where there are more options. <br><br>Also, stop putting famous people who became successful even without college degrees, they are part of the 1%, and most of them are even Americans."
I don&#39;t disagree with your opinion but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good way to discourage others especially younger viewers like me not to pursue college. I don&#39;t know of what will happen though I know most YouTubers are not collage graduates. I think to keep in mind that younger viewers may take this too seriously and not pursue college at all. But I certainly hope for a better future for my country.
"You have to take note that there are a few number of successful people who didn&#39;t really go to college. Say... 20 out of 100 people are successful, those 80 people were not as lucky as those twenty percent"
we go to college but not enough money <br>1 Like=1 Blessings to the pooor
I hate this I&#39;m a pinoy girl I mean my couisin is is in coolage boo hoo amirican should not go to coolage take that Back ha!
Well they are some graduated...
So....<br>Should I drop out of College or nah? I mean I&#39;m at Grade 9 so...
"if I&#39;m rich enough, I won&#39;t go to college haha"
"Very misleading. you as a westerner command people in another side of the world not to go to college?  don&#39;t listen to him pursue higher education knowing that labor force became competitive and only those who have enough credentials made it to the top.<br><br>He rely heavily on talent which is different from intelligence. You can&#39;t be a lawyer or doctor watching only youtube videos, no one hires you to became executive if you don&#39;t have at least undergrad diploma."
Truetrue. I get your point. Hahaha
Need college
you made a good point.
Yea i learn how to build pc in online
Getting a college degree somewhere abroad I think would be better
"I THINK THERE IS A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT SOME OF THIS  BECAUSE MY COLLEGE DEGREE GET ME A SKILLS ON HOW TO MAKE A BUSINESS DECISION, CUSTOMER SERVICE, ADVERTISEMENT AND MARKETING SKILLS."
Mark the CEO of Facebook  is a college drop out and what is it now?....
I think for me having a college degree open a lot of doors and make a good career choices. I have a degree in Business administration for project management.
Why Filipinos? Education or college degree in important to our culture. Mind your own business. Tell it to your people. . .
"i totally agree about this,"
College here is bullshit but we have to im still in 3rd year btw<br>And not all people go to college here in the philippines
"This is very true. Although in the field of computer science here, diploma is necessary it is very hard to get a job without one. One thing I learned is that college cannot absolutely HELP YOU to grow and learn. Let me tell you... I learned how to create a website and computer applications through self study. College on the other hand is bullshit they want you to buy this school shits and buy that school shits just to pass a subject. My classmates laugh at me because I only show up every midterms , now I laugh at them because I earn a huge amount of money than them who works not related to the field we studied because they relied on the insufficient knowledge and skills on college which is not even half-enough to the real world. ONE TIP IF YOU EVER NEED A DIPLOMA DONT WASTE YOUR TIME MUCH ON COLLEGE BULLSHITS  , LEARN TO SELF RESEARCH, BECAUSE COLLEGE CAN ONLY GIVE YOU A DIPLOMA BUT NOT A SKILL TO GET YOU EMPLOYED"
"I love to learn more about the music industry, I am 18 years old. Music is basically my life ~ I haven&#39;t met a vocal teacher yet üòÇ All I did was learn to sing and learn to play the guitar alone ~  I wanted to make my own music but there isn&#39;t a music college here in the Philippines so I have been dreaming on entering a music arts and performance college in korea. But that costs more. I didn&#39;t enter college in the Philippines I told my parents that I am not happy on doing what they want me to do."
you have right...its only the skill matter as of this days...action keeps us more productive..just go on..what we love to do.
"You have to understand David, that in the Philippines if you dont have a college degree, you have 0 chance of landing any white collar jobs.<br><br>And this is just the beginning. The lack of available jobs also is the reason why so many college grads end up going abroad or finding a job that has nothing to do with their college education. <br><br>You can be hired as a janitor, gardener, porter...jobs which doesnt need you to have a special skill."
Fuck Duterte he is a murdering bastard. Mabuhay Ng Rebolusyon!
"Well David, I would agree to your point that going to College will make you waste time because of the skills that don‚Äôt go along with it. But we also Have to understand that Our institutions are still bounded by Industrialized education meaning the system of learning is so 17-18th Century wherein WE ARE IN THE 21st century that supposed that schools should have a globalized education. <br>If you encountered Finland having the best Education to the best of both worlds, it‚Äôs because they have their unique way of interacting to students. And they even planned to remove Subjects such as Math or Science (If I remember it well) that isn‚Äôt relevant to the Kid‚Äôs learning. <br><br>What I want best for the Philippine education system si that we NEED TO INNOVATE not commercialized.<br><br>Yeah Institutions nowadays are commercialized. No wonder students don‚Äôt develop such important skills.<br>In the school where you pay for yout tuition , pay for your OJT, and get your diplomat to show good credentials but at the end of the day. WHERE ARE YOU? <br><br>I am not discouraging anyone to stop going to school but that is the reality. MONEY MAKING INSTITUTIONS. <br>Very Industrialized manner.<br><br>College would have been good if it wasn‚Äôt built for marketing aspects."
"I&#39;m a Filipino and I agree with you. We&#39;re learning for almost 20+ years just to recieve a diploma and have a high paid jobs in the future,but Philippine government has applied the K-12 curriculum which is extending the highschool years. From Pre-School to Middle School we are already spending ten years on learning something. Adding the highschool life which is 6years because of k-12. K-12 is wasting people&#39;s money. üòë. We&#39;ll learn nothing with K-12. I think k-12 is not applicable for Third world Countries like Philillines. It is because Philippine is not as rich as US or Canada to have an extended year in school. Many filipinos are dying because of hunger. Life here in the Philiplines is SO HARD!! Parents are working hard just to pay the tuition fees of there children but their children isn&#39;t studying hard? So why go to college if you&#39;re just wasting your parent&#39;s sweat for nothing?"
"I think you have a point, but that cant be applied to all Filipinos, i think that education is still important for us as we still belong to the so-called third world country, some or maybe most of us here still need to study college   to be a globally competent. We, or me my self still aims that our country will be out of poverty or at least be less of poverty and i think it can happen if people here are more educated. But yes skills are important, i mean very important but we still need college degree for us to quantify for a job and compete globally. I go to school not only for my sake or to earn money for my self but i keep going to school and trying to finish my studies is becuase for my country and country men. We were colonized by many nations and kingdoms before because we lack education we were ignorant in so many things, by the way im nick a social worker student from ph.. Thanks for your concern towards us filipinos. üòä"
"I went for a two year course in college in computer technology. I cant tell if it&#39;s a waste of time though. Fixing pc&#39;s is quite a special skill. Now i&#39;m a &quot;skilled&quot; graphic artist, trained all by myself. I&#39;m working on my singing at the moment though, being part of a choir."
"But you still dont understand ,discrimination is happening and you cant compete if you dont have a degree and poverty is still happening here in Phil. unlike your country"
"One question: How can you graduate from college, and not have a useful skillset? What did you do in college then? ü§î"
"I understand your message, the way you deliver it, that self-help and self-learning is important on finding your talent/skills. And thats a very great strategy for succeeding in life, which is finding your own path and not needing anyones teaching but your own research and observations..<br>But you know, not all people are the same, and we have our own differences. And the world doesnt only need physical works but also some &quot;thinking&quot; jobs, which is pretty serious for me that this knowledge can only get from the actual people who were experienced and known a lot, which we can find from college and teachers, for me. Like innovation, most importantly for agricultural &amp; economical, serious global health issues, and stuffs . And this should not be referring for Filipinos only but for the entire world to embark this to humans on what are their real essence while living its own as a person...<br>I respect your opinion that self-improvement by the help of your self-perseverance is very very important for you to be successful later on. But not all the time, we can learn anything just by ourselves, we need elders and other experienced people to tell us all the knowledge... Thats the real essence : If you learned a knowledge, pass it on. Because you will not last forwver. And we are all humans.. No man is an island. We lived because of other&#39;s help and other people is living because of our help. I believe that not going to college is a very good strategy for OTHERS or SOME or MOST because there are a lot lot lot of ways to learn not just from the internet but also from the real people we communicate with, in order for us to find our own talent which will lead us to our own succession . But it doesnt matter anyways. Because we have our own life and we ourselves have the power to dictate our own life and on how will we drive it, not anyone or anything else will. Everything is just temporary.... And the real issue is Why the people should learn and pass knowledge? I&#39;m from the Philippines, by the way ."
If i ever will have a job i would want to enjoy it instead of being a work slave. Sorry i dont speak english.
TRUE
I agree to what you&#39;re saying but... when it comes to a medical career... you really need a degree and linger to books and practice through internships...

"They need to college u know why ? Because working in McDonald&#39;s u need to havw at least 4 years degree and only until 21 age then after that age u need to be at the certain height, weight and u need to look pretty just to become a custodian at a fast food chain .. Anybody got my point here? Discrimination is pretty much common practice in Philippines even though the job has Nothing to do with it.. Its ridiculous .."
So Skills matter and do what you love.
Maybe idk...collage is kinda a waste of time...and important..i guess
Makes sense!
YouTube is a university?!sign me  in!
"The comments tho lol, &quot;so true&quot; is the basic summary of it (except for a few), where i just say, &quot;admit it. You were just too lazy,&quot; because really, this country (Philippines) won&#39;t let you get jobs that easily without a college diploma. <br><br>Also that cover and title, racist much? XD <br>This video shouldn&#39;t influence us Filipinos, or anyone really, that much. Proper education is needed ya know."
Not exactly the same here in PH here.... even if not needed to go to collage like you said WE SHOULD.... cause here... hard to get a job where greater money is earned without DIPLOMA.... bc you know some Filipino are really...... Lazy..
I finished college in philippines and im pure filipino
hot an excuse for me not to go to college<br>yay
This game changer for me. I am thinking to study and to improve a specific skill that I can enjoy. Now I just need to find it
I prefer doing business than being an employee!
Lots of Filipinos who are not educated are more successful than the educated ones.
You&#39;re right!!
Too late man. Too late
"Here in the Philippines, after you get a college degree, companies won&#39;t hire you unless you have experience... and how can you have experience if they don&#39;t give you one? Ironic it is, but  given that you land a job, how long will it take til your parents get their Return Of Investment in schooling you for 4 years?"
720 who disliked are  college deans &amp; professors
i fuckin love college tho hahahaha
"Learn forex,  stock market trading.  School wont teach you that"
Nope i need to go to collage to get what you want you need to get a collage degree you cant have a job if you dont go to collage we Filipinos need jobs to you know
"i am a living testament to that... it took me almost 10 years to finish a 4-year course.. after graduating, i barely tried to go into practice.. now, im about to embark in a career that has nothing to do with my college degree even in the slightest..."
FACTSSSSSS
"I&#39;ve been thinking about this for the longest time and then suddenly, boom! Someone else puts it in a video much more clearly than I could have imagined. Really reminds me of Orwell&#39;s 1984, but I digress... Just came in here to say that I agree with you 100% -- especially when you say that you should indeed go to college, but with a plan in mind of entering a specific career path -- and only because a college degree is a prerequisite for entry into certain jobs. <br><br>Excellent video. Also, I&#39;m out of the loop so I have no idea who you are, man (no offense meant. I&#39;ll google it)."
"What I don&#39;t like is how Filipinos are RUSHED into college. Like right after highschool, we are PUSHED to go to college and if you don&#39;t, there&#39;s this mindset of being a failure or never amounting to anything. It&#39;s absolute BS."
"my grandmother said go to college and get a degree so that you can work for a good company or you&#39;ll end up a ditch digger my replied to her i will be the best digger in the Philippines i will own the <a href=""http://company.today/"">company.Today</a> i am the only in the many grand kids that did not go to college but i&#39;m the only one that wrote my own paychecks"
Some pretty good arguments there.
<b>subscribes</b>
I realize that after I graduate college üòÇ
"Srry, too late. <br>Im now burning in eternal thesis suffering ;_:"
janitor its the best
"I go to college because I want to, trip trip lang ba. It&#39;s not about the degree but the fun."
"After five years of observation in the Philippines, I am still saddened when I see young people with a college degree operating the cash register. No real job in their chosen field so they take what is offered. The business owner is thinking &quot;hey, why should I hire a high school grad when I can employ a kid with a degree.&quot; It may also be a little bit of charity on the business owners part because they understand the work that went into earning that college education and degree."
Uhhh im a filipino soo its true.... Haynaku heh sorry mga americans
Go to college get a diploma and learn a specific skills
"if only HR of every company thinks like this. honestly speaking, you cannot pass the HR  if you do not have a diploma. base from my experience. they rather hire a fresh grad with 0 job experience than to hire an undergrad with job experience. I&#39;m a freelance programmer and i&#39;m proud to say that my skills are far more important than a piece of paper."
"Vocational or trade school is the way to go, the world would not turn if we&#39;re all doctors, engineers, etc. <br>We need the guys that does the manual labor, the technicians"

Im literally struggling what job should i choose yet i have lack of skills or im really bored at every jobs available
"you have your opinion. i got mine. we have this so called &quot;INTERNET&quot; knowledge is gold, knowledge is everywhere. what picks your interest study that with A LOT of determination and commitment and discipline. Anyway very nice vids! two thumbs up! :) ohh also here&#39;s a sub."
full of holes in your argument<br>... goodluck doing that in the philippines
that‚Äôs why i never go to college. only 3rd year hi scholl
that&#39;s the purpose of k12 program
"You are just trying to justify what you did with your life. You specified my country so I will make my comment.<br>These are my points.<br>1. Some young people does not know what they want to be or to achieve in such a young age that is why college is one avenue for the young to cultivate their interests, expose them to what lies ahead and presents a network of friends and future partners. <br>2. What you are presenting with all these &quot;top 100 billionares without a college degree&quot; hoopla is just dumb. Out of those 100 how many do you think were left unemployed because of dropping out? You very much know that it doesnt only take courage to take the leap but also comes with right timing and circumstance. <br>3. Having a college degree is not a waste of time, as a matter of a fact I consider it an investment, its just 4 years of your entire life teaching you the values of discipline, intellect, hardwork and there you will meet people of same interests that will push you to be better. <br>4. If you are talking about skills and mastery of it. Let me ask you what kind of skill one can master if he lives here in the provinces? You talk about plumbing, electrical works, do you have any idea what the competition looks like for these trades?<br>5. A college degree is a platform for young people to learn more about the discipline of their affinity and forming their network of great people. It also opens a lot of doors in order to achieve one&#39;s goals.<br>6. Quality college education here in the Phils especially in the provinces is not that expensive, there are a myriad of ways to go around it. Having a college degree gives you the freedom to study the disciplines you like that are not available in yoir area to be learned via skills such as BS Ed and engineering courses.<br>This is coming from a chemical engineer who grew in the province, loved science and math when he was a kid and all he saw around him are agricultural fields. Tell me what I could&#39;ve been if I didn&#39;t go to college?"
"I&#39;m a grade 8 student and I don&#39;t think that I can get a Visa if I don&#39;t go and get a college degree. (I researched a bit, about going overseas)"
"I struggled 8 years for a 4 years course that I couldn&#39;t finish Bec. Of financial problems, the point is <br><br><br><br><br>Mag struggle Lang and iyong face hinde Karin magiging successful Kong di bongga any school mo."
Next time be care full what are you talking about!<br>There are meny disadvantage when we dont go to collage.
I love this my parents wanted me to go to college and I dropped out because it was just wasting my time
"Yeah, something you say are true."
"Which would you prefer, the job that you love to do or the one that you don&#39;t but gives you higher salary?"
bitch u just jealous of us
"If one has to stay in the Philippines, better finished a degree even a PhD that will be practical! But going overseas, one should have some skills for a blue collar job...everything has its use. Maybe that was your own experience. Every country is different and have different cultures and priorities....."
"I&#39;m currently taking up BSEd-English, and now I&#39;m starting to loose hope because of the requirements needed to be a public teacher. Most of Education graduates are in call center."
Excuse me
I&#39;m a FILIPINO and I&#39;m aldeady in my last months in college. Its already 4 years too late. like where has this video been all my life?
negra
Well that depends on the passion of the person if he/she will go to college
Why do you need to X The philipine flag then?
"I&#39;m afraid I have to disagree respectfully David, you are just saying what people what to hear and not what they need. As a Filipino my self (Mabuhay Pilipinas!!) the primary reason why people take degree&#39;s I believe, is that the business community requires them. <br><br>If a student truly knows the weight of his Tuition and has a vision of where he&#39;s going, he would develop skills around what the academic community offers. Lazy students will avoid the hassle and hard path to succeed in academics because they were just spoon fed, they did not work for their school. <br><br>Cite a successful person in academics or student working hard for his/her own tution that did not do well in their professional life. <br><br>Saying Bill Gates is successful because he pursued his passion and where he&#39;s good at is only partially true. Bill is a dropout in Harvard not St. Theresa Community College, to be accepted in Hardvard or in some Top Universities requires you to be better in 3-5 different ways compared to most people in a community.  <br><br>What people need to understand is earning a Degree elevates your opportunity for success, not provide one. We are living in a reality where we are equal in opportunity not equal results."
"I agree theoretically, however in practice I disagree. Going to college is almost like getting a license, you may have not learned anything useful but local employers wouldn&#39;t even consider giving you a job if you don&#39;t have a degree. That being said almost everything I know about my job (graphic designer) I learned online. Most of the things I learned in college were mostly just how difficult &quot;clients&quot; (ahem professors) can be especially when they have egos the size of small galaxies. Most of the college lessons were outdated, they didn&#39;t even properly teach us digital or web design in 2008! Again unfortunately while there is truth to what you&#39;re saying, it&#39;s a bit too idealistic. Almost every employer here is still operating on the &quot;we only hire college graduates&quot; mentality. Add to that, without a number of &quot;real-life&quot; experience and portfolio pieces you can show makes it even harder to get hired for any jobs here.<br><br>Right now I am working as a online freelance graphic designer, and from what I can see things like degrees are a lot less of a big deal in this industry. But for those just starting out and getting a feel for your industry, a degree is still a huge technical advantage. With no degree you wouldn&#39;t even be able to rack up experience with beginner level jobs as it&#39;s almost impossible to be hired. Also may I just add that with most &quot;beginner jobs&quot; here a college degree is just the start of a massive list of requirements. Yeah I just graduated, but sure I&#39;ve already mastered every design/web/app software ever invented by mankind (sarcasm).<br><br>I wish though that you&#39;re saying is reality, since college for me was almost a complete waste of time and money. But alas the Philippines is an outdated third world country, it will take some time for people here to change their thinking. Maybe someday it will..."
Ehem!!!!! Ehem!!!!! I‚ÄôM A FILIPINO AND I WANT TO FINISH MY STUDIES TO GET A JOB!!!
Great message but certain career(s) require going to college.
Can&#39;t stop me tho.
"Thank you for that David. But as a Filipino, I don&#39;t think encouraging others not to take up a college degree is not something we should do. Yes, nowadays you can have a good enough job with what you do, and I admire others for that. But there are still those who want to go to college and get a good degree and finish it. Don&#39;t take this offensively, but telling others not to get a college degree is almost like telling others it&#39;s okay to be lazy and flunk your entrance exams. I&#39;m not saying that people without college degrees are lazy, but other people would take it that way. Yes, a lot of people have great skills to make a name for themselves, but there are those who have no access to the right connections to make it. If people DON&#39;T choose to get a college degree, then they have to be completely sure  they have the right connections, the right people to back them up. Can you make a video about that, please? Thank you."
"I would hire an undergrad who is willing to learn the craft than a college grad that has ego because of a piece of paper certifying that he/she attended classes for a certain amount of time. We have a local term for something like that, Diskarte"
"I&#39;m watching your video on my room and I didn&#39;t go to school..it sucks,,, guess I&#39;ll find my skills then...looking forwarx for more...."
I dont need a degree. I just need the school for me to learn all skills to save this planet.
"I agree but i actually study to have a degree and be employed in higher position if ever, it&#39;s like what if i don&#39;t have choice anymore .."
"lol he mentality of the people who disliked this video. tsk kaya di tayo progressive kasi we dont accept new ideas. hes saying the truth.. yun nga lang iba culture dito, we think we really need college but the truth is its not needed. college is for the people who want a degree to be a professional (its okay if you want to become a professional e.g. doctor, teacher, etc.) ... pero we need to learn business kasi money is there. hes not saying that college isnt needed.. it is if you want to be a professional kasi college is only a process in able to get a degree or a license to become a professional but it is not necessary or a basis for success. the point is, most Filipinos are taught to be &quot;workers&quot; (for someone else) not businesmen kaya college palagi ang iniisip. this guy is only telling us that college is not necessarily what you need to take"
You should learn more about filipino&#39;s point of views. I don&#39;t like this video. Encouraging people Not to go to College is a big No No to us. :(
"understanding how life works is much better, than studying things you  do not want just for the sake of some college degree. i learned ater i stopped college that skills is more important."
Your right!!! Skill is the most important i did&#39;nt go to college too. I get job base on my skill and what i just learn in school is to read and how to speak in english üòÅ hahaha the truth is i&#39;m not good in school..
"hm..make sense and honestly it work just fine with me. After 25 years of being self-employed in the US, I&#39;m now retiring and ready to head back home...  Let me also add, neither college nor skill are good enough. One must totaly commit himself to the priciples of hardwork, honesty and integrity to achieved it or else..."
the only disappointing facts are MANY of our citizen with degree holder are ended up working in CALL CENTER! and thats really waste of time.
Many of our citizen just enhance their skills through free training or take vocational course in TESDA.
TRUTH!
"This is so wrong. <br><br>Developing a specific skill set does not mean you do not need to go to college. You need a good foundation in life which going to college exposes you.<br><br>Yeah, academics is not everything. You need a well-rounded education. But a diploma will open more opportunities for employment.<br><br>As for just focusing on one skill-set...like say, polishing and engraving a bowling ball...a machine can do those works now...so where would the individual with no college diploma and only one skill-set get employment?<br><br>Even in the service industry, they require a college degree.<br><br>Sure, there were some who were fortunate to strike it rich even without a diploma, but in reality, that is more the exception rather than the rule."
Dude filipino jobs required mostly college level or grad!!! You are not from here so stfu!!!
Like me I don&#39;t like to finish my studies coz I have a lot of skills ... studying is very wasting of time....waste of money....
"FWIW, as of 2010, less than 7 pct of people worldwide have college degrees. Thus, it&#39;s not true that many people have such degrees. Also, the extensive supply chains needed to make those manufactured parts and materials possible for that house and car involve large, complex organizations and systems. And those involve college degrees. Thus, whatever skill set one wants that doesn&#39;t require a degree will involve energy, mining, manufacturing, mechanized agricultural, and financial systems that are built, understood, and maintained by people with college degrees or better.<br><br>The implication is that far from the claim that we have too many college graduates, it&#39;s the other way round: we don&#39;t have enough graduates. In fact, many Filipinos are lucky if they can even finish grade school and high school. And to make matters worse, college degrees or better are needed to teach them!"
But.Philippines nowadays don&#39;t accept any applicants if that certain individual has no diploma..<br><br>If you have skill..then it&#39;s good for you.but if you don&#39;t go to college here..that is not enough.. You will be poor here hahahahaha
100% agree
college here in Philippines is just a place to get girlfriends/boyfriends
I want to ne your friend!!!! im a Filipino!!
"If what you&#39;re saying is true, that one can be a billionaire without going to college, then why not address it to the whole world and propose a universal rejection to education?  Why Filipinos only?  Because Westerns need to be served by Filipinos with skill sets?  The colonial mind set that you want to impose... You should know that Inequality in life was brought  by Westerns. The world bank that  influences policy in education is western... You are sharing a very dangerous thought."
"I love this vlog. It&#39;s so motivating to us college dropouts. You made me feel enlightened. Thanks a lot,  sir."
"It is true that Collage Schools won&#39;t let you learn what you wanted to learn, but having a Collage Degree might help you. There are still some people who&#39;ll just put their &quot;butts&quot; into your life just for you to move away and not to smell his &quot;Degrees&quot; and money. In actuality, I was hoping to go to a Collage last 2 years ago, but the K-12 Curriculum have been &quot;Activated&quot; and because of that I need to wait another 2 years before I go to Collage and live by myself. For me, by being in Collage allows me to do what I want and plan on what I will do in the future, Collage is just &quot;The Cloak for my Armor&quot; so that I can &quot;Hit two birds in one stone&quot; and never be in danger of being lost in the world. Collage Lost for 2 or more years to gain your degree that you have chosen.<br><br>I am good at math, fans of Anime, Cartoon and YTbers who makes great things and show it to everybody. I&#39;ve started a Drawing when I was still in grade school, sure I&#39;m still not that good to be a part of the top but I can use this opportunity by being in Collage just for me to Learn 3 things.<br><br>1: Accountancy (Recommended by my Parents)<br>2. MultiMedia Animation (The thing that I wanted to Learn in Collage)<br>3. Drawings, Animations, Arts&amp;Crafts (For my Channel that still have less Subs)<br><br>The 3rd one will help me to do what I like, gain money, help others, and accept requests. I might do Computer Programing and Engineering just for me to be able to do more things, getting a Psychologist Degree might help as well. By having these Degrees and Learning what they can Teach you will help you reach something much more higher levels.<br><br>Arts&amp;Crafts will help me reduce Stress and Gain Money, Animation and Drawing will help me to create my Own Anime Someday and Make some random Manga from time to time, Programing will help me to fix the problems on my Devices instead of paying others to fix it, Engineering will help me fix some Vehicles or Machines that just stop working for some reason, Psychologist will help me Understand and again trust from others just by listening and giving advices and It&#39;ll also help me for my way of making a story as well! Allowing yourself Gain Knowledge, Keys for Lock Doors, and Being Happy is important.<br><br>I wanted to Animate, Create, Program, Fix and Gain Trust in my Life. I also wanted to be the First Filipino who is possibly still be a YouTuber who knows Animation and Arts&amp;Crafts who also good at Balancing finances that Fixes Program Errors, Devices, Vehicles and Emotions. I want to be some sort of a salvation that isn&#39;t an Image of a God nor an Angel, not even a Demon. I am a Human Filipino who can Fix any problem that may occur, Living the way we want with no regrets and having the freedom that God himself wanted us to have.<br><br>I&#39;m not opposing your track of mind, this is just my thoughts that I wanted to share.<br><br>Doing something we want while helping everybody, including yourself is better than being a slave who follows orders from their masters.<br><br>I&#39;m a Filipino, a Human who is not an Angel, a Devil, nor a God.

mean
"<b>Filipino Fresh College Graduate here.</b> <br><br>I think what people get wrong is that you <b>don&#39;t</b> study to get a diploma. You study to *increase your knowledge in your chosen field*. You take up Law so you can help people in matters concerning law. You take up Med so you can help save the lives of people who go into your care. You take up Accounting to be able to prepare and examine financial records. You take up Nursing, so you can assist patients. VetMed or Animal Husbandry for the animals you will be healing for in the future. There&#39;s a reason you go to college and it&#39;s not just so you can get a flimsy piece of paper you can wave in front of people to appear &quot;educated&quot;.<br><br>It&#39;s in the learning, and the willingness of a child to learn. I respect your opinion considering this isn&#39;t the first I&#39;ve heard of don&#39;t-stay-in-school statements (boyinaband fan here, and he pretty much talks about don&#39;t stay in school, not just college), but you have to understand where I&#39;m coming from--I just want the people in my country to realize the plethora of knowledge offered and opportunities opened to them when they finish, so we can contribute to the development of our country.<br><br><br>ps. If what you say applies to people of all races, you don&#39;t need to specify or direct this toward Filipinos."
"Very interesting point of view but here in the Ph., having a degree is like having a key to endless possibilities, yeah a lot of graduates are underemployed but that doesn&#39;t mean they have difficult jobs/careers... its easier to find jobs for degree holders than those with tech. skills. don&#39;t get me wrong, i graduated from a technical vocational HS but i still proceeded with my tertiary degree... i think its better to have a degree then learn tech skills along the way.. it really depends on the culture and the country... nurse-emt here and i&#39;m not underemployed and i still have my tech skills as a mechanic and electrician... cheers bro..."
"This is so true, Skills are needed. most likely each skills are improved from Experiences. most of the Filipino does not have the requirements they need to improve these skills. for example a student wants computer engineering, but doesn&#39;t have a computer. in other words a lot of people doesn&#39;t have the resources. but I understand his point. The important part of surviving is having the connections. All you need in order to be able to prove his idea is meeting those people that will serve as a stepping stone. For example, my friend owns an industry. I was able to work in his company without the applying procedures because of the connections. Dozens of successful business owners were able to start from scratch because of their connections with other people. that&#39;s all you&#39;ll ever need."
When i read the title i shock and honestly i get angry i said to my self &quot;what?? Maybe he think filipinos can&#39;t go in college or filipinos knowledge is not good?&quot; i tried to watch it then Yeah I agree we just waste our time and money for nothing we need get diploma just to say we are college graduated. Now Deped add 2 two years (g-11 and g-12) they want us to waste our time and money for that and they proud because 2 years is free (ex. We can enter private school and we dont need to paid for tuition fee) they waste so much money for that and its just 2 years free what will happen to next students will enter g-11 and g-12??
Are u saying that we filipinos should not go to collage because some famous people did not go back to 6 grade
Heck yeah I&#39;m a Filipino nice vid man
But my parents wont allow it. Sad
"I got into a tesda vocational college after graduating I applied to a job to what I like and its very far from my course, I feel like I wasted my 2yrs I should have applied to my job now back then..."
"I agree.,"
"This year 2018 im going to a college. But, if im not going to a college. I make my own &quot;Diskarte&quot; looking for a job like Call center."
PRAISEEE
I&#39;ve wasted 4 years and there is only one thing I learned if you want something you must work for it.
"What&#39;s not being realized in this Video that it is very different here in the Philippines. Here, you might have the skills but if you don&#39;t have a diploma, you wont get hired.<br>Just look at jobstreet - wanted service crew: requirements, college level.<br>Even a secretary will require Collge Degree.<br><br>I just hope you experience what you&#39;re talking about because US and philippines are waaaaaaayyyyy different"
"yeah youre right.. like me, i wasted 5 yrs in college and yet i am a crew in mcdonald. but i love this job.  just do work thats the very   meat."
He is right! Why didn&#39;t I have a mentor like him back when I was not yet in college? I sure wasted my time.
"That might work for the USA but certainly not for the Philippines. It&#39;s improving but it&#39;s still a developing country with a huge income disparity. In cases like that, having more students be able to go to college (since it&#39;s free by now) is much needed. Not only that, the extremely poor can be assured that education helps (plus they won&#39;t have to pay much now). What&#39;s needed is a creation of new jobs throughout the country (not just Manila) that accept graduates.  College education by no means helps. Not everyone needs it but for a country that is still developing in progress it&#39;s is much needed than not having it. Once many are college educated and assured with a great job market, the middle class can increase. Only from that point, can your idea truly work for most since the job market (its really difficult to get a job in that country without a diploma, there&#39;s only a few entry level jobs there that can support you to survive), if that ever happens, is accepting to take non diplomas due to an excess of already skilled workers. Also, the people used as examples aren&#39;t really relatable. Most were able to drop out not because they&#39;re exceptional or smart but because they can afford to; some were from rich/high middle class/middle class families so they already had financial support and job connections of some kind! Plus, most of such people reside in affluent countries with a good job market that accepts non degree holders. In that kind of environment, self employment and being an entrepreneur is not a difficult task for one has lesser hurdles to face."
"It‚Äôs sad but it‚Äôs true, a lot of college grads are jobless in the Philippines, they end up working at fast food restaurants, or at call centers of which they don‚Äôt get paid decently. My observations are if you have some vocational skills, the more you could earn more and get employed faster or simply build your own business. Just sayin‚Äô...."
When somebody tells you not to...then do it....This guy  has zero idea about extreme poverty..I dig myself out thru education...
Filipinos are talented im filipino...hayaan mo sila kalimutan mo nayan sige sige maglibang wag kanang pakahibang dapat ay itawa lang
"Education system in general needs to be changed. Education should prepare us to enhance our skills, talent and intelligence. Not to dictate specific kind of knowledge. because these three things are our foundation for survival. Education system is a dictator that makes us sophisticated slaves."
"I can&#39;t blame the parents for insisting me, though! Colleges have been the only effective way of learning back in the day, and most of them think it still is. With a lot associating a Degree to instant success! If I&#39;m the President, I&#39;ll probably encourage every Colleges/Universities in the Philippines to focus on teaching the specific skill they need!<br><br>I&#39;ve also learned that less quizzes and homework would be helpful to kid&#39;s mental health! No more of that English, Math, PE, or anything we&#39;ve already learned in high school! I get that it&#39;ll be expensive to fire and replace some teachers, but it&#39;ll be worth it in the long run!"
Why go to college when you can do online learning?
yeah its really a waste its just a title of diploma but why do companies required it to have it? even its not the line of your job to get a position. i encountered a richie lady shes applying for a marketing position and she doesnt have any requirements she just drop by and says idont need cv this is me you can ask me anythin u want..and that she can have a sale and get a cota in a day...
"neeeh, in your country you dont have to but in Philippines it is a need and not a want. maybe in your case but its way too different and we filipinos can get a skill-set through our experience."
You can always do both
Becaise of there wants
Definitely true...actually i enter college bcoz of my parents will...but for me its just a wasting time....
You can learn electrical online but you need licensing to do the work.
I went to college because of my parents....
"only 3O% of what they teach of my major of what the real practice is gonna be when i graduate, the rest is gen. knowledge. im a 5th year architecture student, by the way. i agree that its a huge waste of money and time. in between studying, ive work as a carpenter, waitress and CAD operator. ALL IM SAYING IS THAT COLLEGE IS SUCH A DRAG."
"what&#39;s your deal with the Philippines tho? Everything you say about them are either rants or negativity or both, like their their some sort of  slaves,hopeless or poor. Youre a foreigner in the Philippines obviously you&#39;re wealthy so you don&#39;t need a degree but how about people you&#39;re discouraging to be lazy? I mean not that I&#39;m bashing you of being a bad influence but this is why this country never evolves and still financially doomed due to lack of intellectual and highly educated  people."
"I respect your opinion. Even I at one point wanted to drop out of college to work because my teachers seem to constantly think I‚Äôm stupid for not making an effort in studying stupid lessons that need to be memorized. I hate memorizing. It kills my creativity.<br><br>But you know, I won‚Äôt regret that I chose to continue, albeit with a more fitting course than my previous one. There‚Äôs a recipe for success, that I know. One of that includes luck. Not everyone will end up successful especially in this difficult world. You might tell me I‚Äôm wrong but I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes. My uncles didn‚Äôt graduate from college, instead they chose to work immediately after high school. Some of them went to work blue-collared jobs, some established themselves in our community by building connections and at one point they were at the top, having money and all of what you may deem as success but only a few years later, they lost what they had. I asked them why and they answered because they didn‚Äôt know how to keep it that way. Without the knowledge, they were helpless.<br><br>My mom on the other hand, graduated from college. In fact, she‚Äôs the only one among them who did. My mom‚Äôs an administrator of a university now and she‚Äôs the one helping out my uncles get by. She has her job for nearly 10 years now and she‚Äôs doing a good well. In fact, they want to give her a higher position. She wouldn‚Äôt be able to go that far... if she didn‚Äôt have her degree.<br><br>I think, rather than telling them not to go to college... the most befitting term would be... find your passion because in the end... that‚Äôs what‚Äôll lead you to success and if that passion cannot be honed in college, then go out there."
"I think someone has already pointed out that the problem is that a lot of employers would look for some sort of diploma to hire you. At times they won&#39;t even bother interviewing you when they see on your resume that you are just a high school graduate, despite having the work experience and skills."

"You can only said that bec youre rich. Try first sir to become a poor here in Philippines, lets see if you can sleep at night knowing you still have a secured job which college graduates can get easily compare to others who dont have a diploma."
"Hi! You have more opportunities with a college degree in the Philippines. I&#39;m just reminding you, this western kind of thinking does not work in the Philippines! Do u realize most of the poor are uneducated?? If the poor don&#39;t study where would they progress, where would they go?? They may develop the skill sets that you mentioned, hard labor in the Philippines does not give you an amount of money."
its not about you got a degree  its about you do in life your perspective in life its in our called &quot;Diskarte&quot;
Can a 4th year filipino Highschool student like me possibly get a job this early :( if so please help me how to gain this experiences and what company should i go to and how do i tell them that i&#39;ll work for them for free since most of them are searching for people with experiences
"very well said, all on point."
I‚Äôm Filipino and we are pressured to go to college and our life depends on it.<br>No college = no life and dis owned
Im a doctor i wouldnt have become one if I didnt go to college. (Of medicine)
"Wow.. This kinda changed the way I see my self. Though I know my self to have a lot of skills (automotive, housing, electrical/ electronics), I always saw my self as like inadequate because I&#39;m only a vocational course grad. There&#39;s always insecurity when around my engineering grad colleagues. Thanks David this really gave a hike to my self esteem."

Hmm
"I believed that we all have to go college guys and gals. i may say i  agree to what he is saying, but believe me, he never live his whole life in the Philippines. easier said than practiced.  Out here we dont have any good opportunities. . what we should do is stay in college finished the course you chose and leave the Philippines. earn money abroad for  say 10 years and invest in the <br>Philippines after a decade.  your not only helping yourself also other filipinos.  remember those foreigners destroys our country makes us their slaves for 400 years.  now advising us not to go to college for them to enslaves us again. Gising Pinas."
"I do agree with you. I am actually working at a call center being a highschool graduate and when i was applying for the job, i was with other applicants as well who had college degrees and i thought to myself that if i had finished college, i would just be with these people but with just a piece of paper that says &quot;im a college graduate&quot; and be still in the same room as them and now i am a manager and they are still working as a regular employee. That proves to me a piece of paper is not a basis of what you should be in the future."
Going to college is a scam. Lol<br>You are right somehow
Just be on tesda direct learning then go abroad boom no need for college.
"I really wanna be a musician but my parents keeps on telling me to get a degree so just in case I fail in my dream there&#39;s always a plan b, but I know if they just support the life that I want for my self, I know I&#39;ll succeed. Thanks for this video, it really made me feel that I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this way, though I will still be going to college this year because of my parents but if there&#39;s only a way to tell my parents and make them realize this, I would do it. Thank you very much. You made me feel inspired to do more music."
You&#39;re right on what you said
"Philippines is different from America. In Philippines inorder to work in a company you need a degree, while in us you jus need skill.  In philippines your skill doesnt matter if you dont have degree."
"100% totally agree I know someone finished college, now his jobless. The other one didnot even finish highschool, but he has this skill that he loves to do now he has highpaying stable job"
"I agree with you in some points, actually I think it is a waste of time and money to go to college then end up in call centers, become chefs, etc.. Unfortunately, for now, it&#39;s still taboo not to go to college, older generation would tell people it&#39;s laziness not to go, it&#39;s stupidity not to dream of becoming a nurse, doctor, lawyer, engineer, architect or at least a teacher. But for those who are carefree, they&#39;re lucky. They get to choose skill courses and later on have TESDA certificates and let them land on jobs that make them really happy. I hope the generation of teens today, when they become parents, they didn&#39;t carry with them that taboo mindset. Having many skilled workers is better for the Philippines than seeing those discouraged poor people beg on the streets thinking it&#39;s too expensive to even hone skills. I am a teacher and with what&#39;s happening to the crazy requirements of renewing our license, I&#39;m thinking maybe I&#39;ll learn another skill and embrace a job related to it. Good insight, thanks for this video."
We study college  for job competition! And skills and talents and trainings are extra
Thanks to this video. I finished college but its kinda not useful.
"I am an I.T. Graduate and I totally agree that it&#39;s a total waste of time in my life. I&#39;m earning money for being a Freelance Sales Specialist, a little communication and keeping business relationship to clients to keep the sales higher than ever. There are times I sit at home earning money for doing nothing. I still use my I.T. skill for fixing my friend&#39;s or my personal computer."
"I decided to quit attending university last year. I was taking a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Graphic Design and Multimedia and let me tell you one thing: I learned more watching videos and reading tutorials online than my 2 years in college. I know there&#39;s still a stigma when it comes to being a dropout here in the Philippines and it is quite a struggle since you have people around you constantly reminding you of getting a degree or else you&#39;ll end up nowhere, which is not the case. I personally do not recommend dropping out of college with impulse but rather you should be aware of what situation you are getting yourself into. In my case, I never actually needed a diploma for my course because it uses portfolio and applied skills as a basis for me to get hired more than a piece of paper. <br><br>Unless you want to be in the medical field or other professional careers, I don&#39;t think college is that significant as what it used to be."
I regret going to college because I was not able to finish it. I should have followed my passion instead.
Work on your Passion and be good at it and Let your Craft Speak for yourself
"Filipinos aren&#39;t that privileged to participate in the jobs that does not require college degrees. The main reason is that there are no job openings here for people like that aside from the jobs with the lowest salary and the entertainment industry, and you have to be talented or attractive to even join the latter... heck even if you&#39;re talented it is still fairly hard to make a living out of the entertainment industry. The only reason why people w/o college degrees barely survive in our country is because the community itself won&#39;t support the idea of a community where people don&#39;t need to go to college."
"yeah, college here is just waste of money and time but we can&#39;t find a PROPER AND GOOD JOB if we didn&#39;t graduated in a college school. . Business is hard these days and companies prefers college grads."
Im afraid i cannot do that in my family course degree is a must my family we&#39;re all close minded idiots
THIS IS SO TRUE!
Don&quot;t be like most Americans who are not highly educated...because it takes a lot of money to be part of good education that only Harvard University can offer.  But yes...develop a skill that will serve as fall back....after all...it is always nice to be educated....money is not everything!!
The title was kinda offending but since I heard what your saying I think your correct
Nice mind opening!
"I&#39;ve watched and heard enough. I&#39;m a BA graduate with a very stable and a fulfilling job. You work in an industry with no educational requirement which is quite understandable for your opinion. Though, you SHOULD change your video title. It&#39;s very misleading. This what I hate the most about idealists and generalizations. <br><br>I knew a lot of people with no college diploma and they were all rejected by huge companies. If you wanna work in corporations (hey, this doesn&#39;t need a license to work in such industries like marketing), they will definitely shred your resume by just looking at a high school graduate&#39;s resume. Why do I know? I had worked with companies where we print on rejected CVs. Wanna be promoted into a Manager? Become a CEO of an existing well-known company? Get the degree. <br><br>Many times that I also applied for jobs where companies will outright ask if I am a college graduate. It doesn&#39;t matter what course. They just want to know if I finished studies. Skills? We do have skills. We definitely have that certain dignified professionalism where we rarely see among people who didn&#39;t finish their studies. We end up scratching our heads because of them. I lined up in many job hirings and college graduates do have wisdom. You should go meet many college graduates. This video proves how small your world is. <br><br>Speaking of money. Not everyone is talented in handling their money. A healthy economy have employers and employees. Never belittle employees. They build some people&#39;s ambition while fulfilling our own. <br><br>College should at least be an option to a person&#39;s development. You can both degree and skills. <br><br>This is the very reason why most foreigners lose their jobs to immigrants like Filipinos. We do have degree, great personality/attitude, and skills."
Filipinos go to college because we have money to school in college
"That, i guess how TESDA works somehow..."
Hoy huwag kang
Hard to say it but i agree. Lots of grad not enough jobs. anyway I&#39;m a college student and I don&#39;t actually like the degree that i&#39;m trying to get. I want to be an Aviator and the most practical way to get that dream is to just enlist to the army. hahaha
"I thought it was a racist thing but, after hearing you, I agree with you. And I&#39;m sensitive on racist slurs not as a Filipino (which I am) but as a person"
"and FYI youre followers who commented here and agrees with you are all &quot;tambays&quot; at home and always asks money from their parents or whoever. COLLEGE TEACHES YOU THE VALUE OF TIME AND MONEY, THE VALUE OF RECOGNITION, IT ADDS UP TO WHO YOU ARE AS A WHOLE PERSON. fyi.again yours is an UNEDUCATED OPINION."
"i have to disagree, In college you are there to learn if you&#39;re suited to the degree you&#39;ve chosen, then change courses. FYI NOT ALL FILIPINO PARENTS DECIDE FOR THEIR CHILD&#39;S DEGREE.  I&#39;m sorry but we are a 3rd world country. Education is very important and it will give you a lot of opportunities. yes some people are successful without going to college but those were the lucky ones. HOW CAN A CLIENT OR ANYBODY TRUST YOU IF YOU DON&#39;T HAVE A DEGREE? OR EVEN TALK FLUENTLY IN ENGLISH OR ANY LANGUAGE? HOW CAN YOU APPLY JOBS ABROAD? OR EVEN LEARN THE BASIC STUFF IN EACH TYPE OF COURSE? i&#39;m sorry this is misleading and you are telling your followers that college is a waste of time. LET ME TELL YOU A LOT OF COLLEGE GRADUATES HERE ARE SUCCESSFUL AND FINANCIALLY STABLE BECAUSE OF IT. MAY IT BE ABROAD OR LOCAL. MOST OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND ARE MY BIG CLIENTS RIGHT NOW. MOST OF THEM CAME FROM THE BEST UNIVERSITIES HERE. MY POINT IS ITS AN UNEDUCATED OPINION TO SAY COLLEGE IS WASTE OF TIME."
"I think if one would go to college they should enroll in courses which are technical courses like 4 years mechanic not Mechanical Engineering or BS Electronics,  BS Aircraft Maintainance Technology (Aircraft Mechanic) BS Radiology Technician(Technology!) and other technical courses. Enroll in ladderized courses so that if you can not finish the 4 year courses you can still have a skill."
"I shouldn&#39;t discourage someone to go to college here.  Having a degree will help them to expand their opportunities.  I think it is more better to say dont waste time on the degree that dont interest you so it will not go to waste.  High School sucks here.  Even if I&#39;m interested with computers...I didn&#39;t really get to have hands on experience until college.  I don&#39;t think there are many people who would like to take an apprentice who doesnt even know the basics of what they do.  Did you know that to apply for a cashier here requires a college degree? What you are saying is true for few cases but in reality companies here do not look for skillset, if they see your resume do not comply on what they call standards, your application will probably end up on the trash bin.  Not all people are being blessed with the privilage to know someone who can mentor them.  Maybe in the future if philippines can have decent paying jobs that doesn&#39;t require ridiculous requirements.  Applying a job here even as a fastfood crew requires money.  they wont accept you if don&#39;t have govt certificates NBI, Police, (both are from the same list), mayor permit, health permit, medical and dental exams, some even require an NSO birth certicate which is ridiculous because its the same paper with the same details you can get from the local municipal office. And this will cost you around 3 thousand pesos.  Plus it will take you few days to get all these because their offices are located in diff places.  You are applying to have job for money..but you need money first to apply for a job which until now I cant understand."
I am aircraft maintenance 4th yr. Student undergrad. At PhilSca batch 2008. I&#39;ve never have any job related to Aircraft how much I tried to apply even though I have some lots of seminars I have attended the reason I guess is bureaucracy and the industry is so small.  I love cooking sisig and tapa is my fave now I own 4 store and I have 15 employee. I hope this inspire others the lesson here is don&#39;t put yourself in a box don&#39;t other discourage you make your hobby a business.  Experience is the great teacher.
"this is very true unless you want to have a specific profession that requires a degree but if you have a specific skill that you think you&#39;re good at and really want to have a college education for the sake of going to college, i suggest taking a 2 year course of what you are really interested into and put that in practice after you finished the course"
"Please don&#39;t take his words too literally. Point of his message is this: If you know you&#39;re really good at something or would really like to do something as a career that doesn&#39;t require going to college, go ahead and pursue it! Invest your time and money in polishing your skills instead of spending it for irrelevant things or not doing anything at all (tambay), which totally makes sense. Any skill deteriorates when not developed/improved. (e.g. Go on a vacation leave for a month, then report back to work. Some even forget their PC login already) <br><br>Some careers this could work are in the fields of arts, crafting, sports, and even tech, which requires creativity, instinct, physical capabilities. <br><br>This doesn&#39;t apply to all careers/professions and has obvious excemptions just like in the field of medicine and most sciences. <br><br>I hope you find this comment helpful.<br><br>I&#39;m 26 and currently work in the BPO industry. Also practicing and self-learning how to record songs/music, as well as Asian languages."
why
"So sad, most comments just agree with your video. You may read as many quotes from famous and powerful people and apply it to your life. But the truth is, what worked for you, may not work for someone else. We all carve our own path uniquely from each other...Yes there are college dropout that got rich that got famous, but there are also college graduates who are doing fine, so which path should one take?... this video is creating an illusion of problem<br><br>Spending money in college is not the problem... it all boils down to grabing opportunities in front of you<br><br>To simply explain, maraming magaling kumanta sa pinas, are they as famous as you? Do they all earn the same as you? Probably not.. skill is not everything, there are other factors<br><br>Let them carve their own path, if they cant or dont want to, then its their problem and that is where someone should step in and rectify the problem and not spread false belief about going to college<br><br>I have learned some skills from youtube. Cooking, electronic repairs, plumbing, website building, djing etc..all started with zero knowledge... didnt work for me... <br>and now im back in college @34yo<br>To pursue a new path"
You&#39;re absolutely right. If you add value to a company they will want you even more. Degree&#39;s don&#39;t really show that specially now.
for me much better you have to finish college degree..because only that u&#39;r wealthy..and easy to find a good job if you finish a college degree..that&#39;s your good future in your life.
In my experience. I go to college but i didn&#39;t finish it due to financial problem. So i just started as a fast food crew and ended up as a encoder. As time pass by my set of skill typing increase and gets me another job as a encoder at a logistics company which give me a experience handling advanced excel. And now im working as a regular payroll associate earning a decent amount of money. Thank you for sharing this video. I just think of my self now haha.
I agree:-)
Thats very true
Wish my parents understand this.
You got the point.
"There is truth to your explainations.  However if you are working for yourself and making good money, there is a potential problem.  Let me explain; <br><br>I went to college and got a lic.   I worked as an RN on governement jobs paying into pensions plus social security (I also saved)  So, when retirement age came around, I retired with a good income.   <br><br>Now if you work for yourself and make &quot;great&quot; money and you are not diciplined to save, you are screwed when retirement age comes around.  I believe there are millions of people like that.  They did not save for retirement and then they have to work for the rest of their life.  <br><br>Also, your skill or business might become obsolete.  Or you might have a great business making 7 figures and then several other businesses show up with the same thing at a lower price.  Your screwed.  This stuff happens and there are people that are in their 70&#39;s and have no choice but, still work.  <br><br>Get a college degree.  If your &quot;self employment&quot; fizzles out 10 years down the road, you could get hired by a company with the degree.  No degree?  The best you will do is minimum wage.  Yep you do need a college degree."
"I saw the title, I thought he was putting a negative remark. But this is actually a great analogy."
Very true David! I thought it&#39;s just only me who has the principle like yours... I&#39;m a Filipino by the way.
That&#39;s your opinion  but for me I still prefer to get a degree at the same time work on the job that I love so that i don&#39;t have regrets in my life.
I Agree with you
I have some skills when it comes to fixing computers and Cellphones but one skill that I&#39;m good at is Drawing and Character designing. I didn&#39;t finish my course in marketing because I saw something isn&#39;t right about it and question if is it really worth it. I soon go to a trade school and will soon get my license in animation.
"tamad na din mga teacher ngayon depende sa school, pati ang daming unecessary na fees, Vocational courses is the answer to get a decent job here but most likely abroad for a better salary, Goverment and education system here is corrupted and not worth the money. Lagi na lang ako minamaliit dito kase ndi nakapagtapos pero ung mga nakapagtapos saan napunta? tambay ung iba, may pamilya na, iba ang trabaho sa kinuhang kurso, ndi masaya sa trabaho."
"I respect your opinion!but as a filipino please don&#39;t encourage us not to go to college.Having a college degree is the only way for us to have a better work and better life so please don&#39;t compared us to yourself were not born rich like you,we need to work hard to have a better future."
"I respect your opinion!but as a filipino please don&#39;t encourage us not to go to college.Having a college degree is the only war for us to have a better work and better life so please don&#39;t compared us to yourself were not born rich like you,we need to work hard to have a better future."
"if you went to college you tend to find job not create one, while those who don&#39;t create jobs thinking they can&#39;t find one because they never went to college"
"But I already finished college, how to undo finishing college?"
Does that mean I don&#39;t need to go to college just to have a great work for me to help my family??? btw I&#39;m a Filipino and I&#39;m only 12 years old...üòäüòäüòä
Before k-12 i was excited for collage but now we have grade 11 or 12 and i have 8 years left until i graduate
Why filipinos are going to west to clean the westerners mess. Like cleaning toilets etc. Because most of them are lazy. And filipinos dont care on their world they all want to work and send money to their families.
its like im listening to a pyramid who talks ....
"lets make a senario.<br>you&#39;re good in math.<br>not just simply good but so obsessed with it and go to a bank then say &quot;i wanna be an accountant here&quot;<br><br>and go to another bank with full requirements..<br><br>lets see whats the difference.<br><br>well i guess what will they say to you without a college degree is &quot;get the hell out of here you freakin&#39; drunk or else we&#39;ll call a cop.!&quot;<br><br>and if you mean go for your skill, it would still involve a huge amount of money in order to make it successful<br><br>if you&#39;re saying just start in small and grow, you&#39;re saying just relly on your luck.<br><br>why would i go for luck if theres a bit longer yet proper way of a better future.?"
"currently taking up a course in line with game development and sadly some of the subjects that I have , have profs that just let you do things on your own. they are their just to guide us but mainly we learn the lessons through the internet(mainly youtube and khan).and I always thought I could just to do this on my own without enrolling myself in college. but still there are pros to be here I already have a direct line/connection to the industry Im about to enter and already being trained for the standards in the industry . so if anyone reading this and have plans to enroll in a game development course here in the ph and you already know that you have passion for coding/making video games then maybe you could just do it on your own and save your money.(ps: in my case It was too late for me since I only discovered my passion after transferring to this course)."
I agree But its really needed if we dont go to college no diploma too no works but still its trueüòñüòñüòñüòñ
Before I start this video. I hope this makes absolute sense or else imma snap.
"hi. i just need your opinion on my case. i see myself in HR DEPT soon. is the skill set of studying the bahavior of humans can be studied online? youtube, etc.. i think working in hrd should have a college diploma right? practical exams and what we have studied shoumd be applied to the human behavior. thanks in advance"
"I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t agree with you.  If u I didn&#39;t get a degree in Accountancy I wouldn&#39;t be be an accountant at all.  I now live in the UK and my degree helped me get a job here, I accredited and now I have career that I wouldn&#39;t imagine back then.  So guys, make sure you go to college be a use you will never know where this takes you..."
"I appreciate our concern for the Filipino youth and I&#39;ve understood your thoughts but at some point, these cases aren&#39;t applicable to each and every one of us. I found your opinion on chasing your own dreams really adoring, because everyone deserves to live the life they&#39;ve wanted, but the entire video kind of gives a negative vibes towards education. Yes, some skills can be acquire by learning through computer but not everything is accessible in the internet leaving the less fortunate unaware of the knowledge they could have received within side their fellow men. For an example, my mother wasn&#39;t able to step into college due to poverty, sure she&#39;d been able to work for a living before because only few companies requires a degree but it&#39;s different today, it has become an essential to have great opportunities, she could have gained more knowledge than me if she was able to study in college, she could&#39;ve been more proud as she was knowledgeable as the person of her age but she looks down on herself everytime she remembers that wasn&#39;t able to. We could&#39;ve been fortunate today if she was able to get a higher pay from  being in a higher position job, but guess what, I am now trying to give them their dream life while I enjoy learning new things aside from chasing my dreams, and you shouldn&#39;t have made education look like that as it was one of  instruments our countrymen used to ask for change, equality and our freedom from our previous colonizers."
No ...its not a waste of time...
"I was about to roast you, until I watched the full video...."
Thanks so much. Nice advice.
"You are right that it is a waste when you have to do a job you have to apply because you have no choice... and wrong if you are going to be working on fields that needed to be taught at college.. society has made it harder for those really skilled and hardworking ppl to get jobs that they wanted to do.. discriminations on where you took your college, what college you went to and if you have connections are some of the reasons many have to accept jobs the are overqualified.. many idiots end up on good places because they know someone inside a company.. still, having a degree is a yes as it will give you more oppurtunities.."
"I am a filipino,  I should finish my college because my mom said so, tho I suck already.  I actually hate my course. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
College is the step forward to getting necessary education and improved your chances of job prospects. Degree is a proof of valid education and makes you more employable
"Filipino ako, so bawal ako mag-college?"
This is what I always think as a Filipino but my parents are like your gona be a homeless if you dont go to college
WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE YOUR LIFE BECOMES A MESS
"Wow, great views on life. I thought this was going to be extremely racist and ignorant, but it was actually good and made sense."
Yes someone defended me cuz I really don&#39;t want to go to college
What about the stories of less fortunate families who went to college and finished and got better paying jobs or started businesses aside from their regular jobs.
Huh!!!
"Going to college is never a waste of time! It&#39;s an EXPERIENCE! It&#39;s not just about academic learnings but about LIFE! You get to meet a lot of people, build friendship and learn from experiences, if you know what I mean. Being a &#39;skilled&#39; person WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE is still way better than just being skillful."
"Why Filipinos,,,,im filipino"
Thats true... Its not on the paper.. its on the experienced..
you don&#39;t know crap if u are in the Philippine n you have no education they won&#39;t hire you even if it&#39;s applying for job at joleebee who do you think they hire some one with a degree or some one with out one
So stupid!!! Hope youtube delete this video.
"You are right, these days you can see a lot of college graduates with no proper skills at all. A lot of Filipinos experience poor colleges in the country, n<br>only some universities look at skill. I hate the educational system in the country, schools favor requirement and project completion than skills and knowledge gained."
You look like the joker fella from batman.
"That&#39;s probably true if your only goal in life is to earn money. But colleges and universities were not established just to produce workers; they are there to shape people and further their knowledge of a field through research (by &quot;research,&quot; I don&#39;t mean Google search lolz ‚Äî I mean graduate and postgraduate studies), which you CANNOT achieve without a degree, unless you have Einstein&#39;s IQ and can learn on your own and develop breakthrough ideas without earning a degree.<br><br>Also, can&#39;t you be a skilled degree holder? Why is it a waste of time to go to college if you&#39;ll learn a lot doing so? Isn&#39;t learning worthwhile? And no, you cannot learn &quot;literally&quot; everything through Youtube, because if people can, then we might as well shut down every school in the country and just watch Youtube instead. Sounds about right, doesn&#39;t it? Not.<br><br>Saying that people SHOULD NOT go to college is dangerous and anti-intellectual. Maybe SOME people don&#39;t have to or simply can&#39;t because intellectual abilities don&#39;t permit them to, but &quot;Filipinos should not go to college&quot;? Wow, like everyone has business pursuits and acumen.<br><br>And by the way, I noticed that a lot of your videos center on earning money, like it&#39;s the ultimate end goal of one&#39;s existence. Goodness gracious."
"True..i didnt finish my college, but now as a teppanyaki chef here on a cruise ship,im more succesful than my classmates who graduated their college( engineering)"
"but you can&#39;t get higher ranks if you don&#39;t go to college and get that sweet certificate! like for example, a seafarer, you can sail the sea being an deckboy or engineboy but the highest rank you&#39;ll gonna get is AB or motorman so you need those cert. to prove you&#39;re competent but even if you got all of the requirements, you still need to get those connections so in reality, skills don&#39;t move your ranks but friends or family(it is called backer system, someone recommends someone even if they are not qualified they will still get the jobs because their backer is friends with the employer) does."
"I&#39;m sorry but i don&#39;t concur with your opinion. A University Degree is not only about earning money. Filipinos, Don&#39;t listen to his advice, get a Degree and don&#39;t be a numb skull like some Americans. They can survive without their degrees because many are living on welfare/ dole outs from their government."
you&#39;re speaking as an AMERICAN. You&#39;re speaking as a MAN with money.  Bill Gates?Franklin? from what decade are they? this Video is a Cancer.
"that&#39;s the reality bruh, thats the filipino race, every HR&#39;s here in the Philippines priority the person with diplomas, hows that sound? dont be encourage them to stop learning at school, u making them ignorant"
It is Because theirs a lot of requirements and  expensive.
"Do you know how a successful company&#39;s HR desk look like in the philippines? table full of resumes. And do you know what happens to people applying for a job without a degree?. Even a simple Milk Mixer in a Plant has a college degree here. High school grads resumes are thrown in the trash bin not even reading it halfway through. Its tough to swing blindly here in the philippines, competition is so tight and the wage is so damn abysmal. A security guard who risks his life protecting something only earns as much as 12k pesos, specially in the province, thats like 244$ a month not to mention the graveyard shifts. If I learn trade and skill and leave college, I better have the luck and money to leave the philippines and be a plumber or wielder abroad. If i was so unlucky to have a criminal record like theft or whatever. good luck getting a passport. I&#39;d say I wouldnt risk it. Id still go to college then learn crafts. Thats what most of the filipinos do and its practical."
The people who dislike this video are probably parents üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is what I&#39;m doing right now. BTW I&#39;m a Filipino.
i did not go to college but i am a succesful businessman..  joke. hello im FILIPINO here in Korea im a factory worker . .. i guess FILIPINO should go to college if they like a highly paid and super easy job and you can also be corrupt.  if they won&#39;t go to college maybe they will be like me a slave for other country serving them with my blood and sweat in working so hard. if we are rich before i think i have my diploma for a better job. but i had no regret at all because my life is better now than before i just put up my own house my parents house and i also have vehicle and business there in philippines .i just want to have a simple life i don&#39;t like money but i need money to live. goodluck for your lives everyone. all people die iwant to be happy with my family for the remaining time of my life.
greeting from a Filipino: its better to quit school and go to work. I just quit going to school last yr trying to find a job from now on. good vid.
"what you neglect to mention, perhaps you do not know, even menial jobs need a college degree to get the job  those without the degree are not considered.  You should really know what you are talking about if you are going to go on about a subject."
Ya but try to get a job in the electronics area or computers if you don&#39;t have a degree.  I learned to repair mainframe computers in the USAF for 8 years but no big computer company would even talk to me without a degree.  So just having a skill is not always all you need.  Now as you say if you work for yourself you don&#39;t need a degree.  I did get a job working on computers and networks at smaller companies and did this for 40 years but could never get a job at the name brand companies.
Not all people are talented with running a business. A lot of people set up their own business and there is a high rate of failure. Its true you wont get rich being an employee for life. But if you have no talent for business you wont get rich either.
we need skill sets not overpaid diplomas
"I beg to disagree! I find your &quot;title&quot; very appalling. Yes, in some points you were right. For me, getting a college degree is not a waste of time neither of money! And for Filipino&#39;s getting a degree is big thing, especially for the parents which considered education as the best thing they could give their children. Maybe the thing is, it is the course mismatch that is hindering somebody to succeed into its field of study. But telling somebody not to go to college is like encouraging somebody to drop out. Better say, chose a course in line if your passion. And besides, if Filipino&#39;s were not going to go to college, who will work for the rest if the world?"
"yup, also most college degrees won&#39;t guarantee you a job after graduation nowadays...it&#39;s true, it happened to me, I got a job after 5 years but got fired eventually because I failed their 15 days evaluation. I know it&#39;s so lame of me; FUCK ME...."
while i agree that one needs to develop a specific skill to be your career in life i dont think doing away with college is a good idea especially in the philippines most if not all companies require a college degree to get a decent job and not having a diploma puts you in a disadvantage over someone who has . ive seen 50 to 100 applicants vying for one job position how can one compete in the corporate world without a degree? besides there are  lot of of young people who are not even sure what they want to be in life even after they graduate high school. furthermore how do you support yourself if you are going to work for free for 6 to 12 months?
Really good advice man.
I&#39;m proud  of my self because of this video.  Technician here by the way.. And I love it.  Puso pilipinas.

"College/University may be a waste of time but some people want to waste time because they&#39;re unsure what they want to do in life as of yet. Of course when you know you what you want to do, it is a great idea to use your time more wiseky."
Good advice David. I&#39;m inspired with what you have said. Filipinos have this mentality that you can&#39;t have a job if you don&#39;t have a college degree. Even if you don&#39;t have a job as long as you have a degree then you are better than anyone else. That&#39;s what most people think.
Thanks bro .you give me a good idea&#39;s.
"I&#39;m also a filipino, high school graduate but I&#39;m proud of who I am right now. Working outside my country was my simple dream when I was young. I want to travel and see the beauty of some interesting places even if it takes me time and effort to be there not a tourist but as a working stranger. I don&#39;t care what kind of job I could have at least I am qualified and capable of doing that then I&#39;d go ahead. Learning to speak English although I&#39;m not good as much but as long as I can speak and understand English language is my first tool of achieving my dream. It&#39;s really fun to discover and explore outside our comfort zone and don&#39;t only depend of what we have learned from school. Learning more in life aside from that is a lifetime experience. There are so much more in life to be learned. I&#39;m not bragging, honestly I graduated as a class valedictorian in high school. Some universities offered me a scholarship in college but I didn&#39;t take it. Instead I go with my own way although it was a great opportunity for me which I&#39;ve really missed out. Im not encouraging you to do the same but it&#39;s all up to you how you choose your path. And whatever path you have chosen there always be hardships and obstacles along the way but you just gotta be strong enough to stand firm to achieve your goals in life. I just want to share my own experienced to convince my fellow Filipinos to be inspired by the possibilities rather than confined by limitations. If there&#39;s no opportunity around the corner try to find it out on the other side or even outside of where you are right now! Thanks for the inspiring videos I hope you can inspired more Filipinos especially the new generations to always have a positive outlook in life and have the courage to follow their dreams no matter what. More blessings üòä"
Yes true
"I am an aircraft mechanic and I can work in any mechanical jobs, and I only studied for 18 months. And now I work for a world class airline.

I&#39;m a college drop out and guess what? guys who are reporting to me are college graduates..
"Education is the key for make of Philippines a competitive player in the modern world.<br>Who is this guy to say to us why we shouldn&#39;t go to school? Ridiculous. <br>Somebody who had an education telling to other people to don&#39;t?<br>Music is great but you don&#39;t build roads, bridges or houses with a guitar, this kind of things you learn in university. <br>Thumbs down for this guy üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ"

"I Agree to this guy realtalk this is the reality of life so stop fantasizing...... <br><br>ErwinWabe commented:<br><br>This is the kind of western mentality that causes you to loose your job to immigrants. I&#39;m in Canada a lot of locals who lost their jobs not knowing why they lost their jobs to immigrants. You know why? They learned their skills in high school only and went straight to work to cash in some checks and the immigrants have bachelors degree, obviously who have more skills? And a lot of locals here who have huge titles and lost their jobs to immigrants who does not have titles but have more skills, why? Because we know the value of education and we take advantage on the opportunity learn? It&#39;s not just a diploma it is attestation of the wisdom and skills that you earned from your studies and those who graduated and still do not have skills it is because they think that it is just a diploma.Your video is misleading everyone. You are sighting bill gates, steve jobs etc. Guess what these people were in the right place at the right time and exceptionally intellegent? You are speaking about what less than 1% of the population? What is the population of the philippines. Finding jobs in a country like philippines where supply and demand applies and where sadly discremnation applies too. Your principles applies to those who do not have even a slightest chance of going to college. Do not add to the already confused generation."
You couldn‚Äôt be more right! I have told some of the people close to me that getting an education or going to college is not necessary to earn money. Getting a master at doing or making something is more than enough to earn or make money.
I super agree with u. I did not get college degree but I&#39;m more successful and earn more money than my friends with what they call DIPLOMA.
"I think the certificate is useless because going to college lacks what we call &quot;the job experience&quot; but if they do change it to something like an apprenticeship style. Let student experience real job related to their degree for a year or two. Also, even with the skills some students still go to college because that particular college is well known and it will be a stepping stone. I think students should go to college and actually pay attention and not just read the textbooks. Ask questions, be more curious, be more creative, work hand, inspire or help other students, and socialise. But some do get successful later in life without going to college but doesn&#39;t mean that you should not go to college."
I agree..but it would also affect your chances of promotion if you do not have management skills which I know can be developed by having a Bachelors degree...promotion for a job means also having a degree..just my opinion

We do have the same mindset. I learn differently.
yes Why the Philippines or the Filipinos are your topic?  focus on your country there not us!
Callcenters look for skill sets!
I totally agree with you.<br>I&#39;m a Filipina and currently in college. I also think college is just a waste of time and money but I can&#39;t just not go to college because ofc my parents and I need a diploma. I&#39;ve been unmotivated to study ever since my 1st year of college (I&#39;m now in my 4th yr) because I think experience is better than &quot;studying&quot; in college for years but only to remember a few but.. <b>*sighs*</b> cant apply if I don&#39;t have a diploma üò™ sad life.
"I finished nursing. Not because it is my passion, but because my parents thought it was the best to have a degree. Did i make it becoming a nurse? Nope, i decided to focus on my gaming which im really good at. Ive won a lot of mini-tournaments and earns money with just gaming. I just realized that ive wasted many years of my life just to receive a piece of paper and a photo."
"easy for you to say because you dont live the life we live. in phils no company will hire a manager without a managing degree. rely on just pure skills? good luck with that. i doubt if u survive in just 200usd a month. maybe u do, just as your u said on ur other video &quot;why filipino dont get rich&quot; u dont give ur family money. well, as u said we are filipino. there are more important things to us than money. let say seeing our family happy, safe and secure. that alone, makes us happy. clearly u r speaking opinion. but u are also blind by what is really the reason why us filipinos still want to go college and why we help our family."
Spot on...
White boy from 1st world country has a different point of view in life compare to a brown filipino living in 3rd world country who doesn&#39;t even have a chance to travel to the next town from his place. the point is people live in different degree of life.

"You have the point that going to college is worthless a scam etc..... And focusing in your skill is the one that need more attention here in the Philippines .....<br>................................................... But Senior high school  here in the Philippines have TVL... Teachnical Vocational and Livelihood Education that focuses on the skill of every students less in lessons but more on pratical assessment that you have to perform a certain skill that you can improve...... <br>Philippines is Philippines already that how companies work here that you should have diploma to have the job, that you have the diploma to be a cadidate for that position....that the cycle here............. Self discovery or developing your skill by your own here in the Philippines is hard, not all the filipinos can afford Internet or have internet.... We still have provinces that don&#39;t have Internet access thats why it is hard to learn by yourself .... And they even have lack of knowledge when it comes to modern-day they even don&#39;t know how to use modern gadgets *I&#39;m not pertaining to all people in provinces, just some of them*..."
"I definitely agree when you said don&#39;t go to college if you don&#39;t really aim for a specific &quot;necessary&quot; skillset for a specific job. <br>I didn&#39;t really want to go to college. My parents wanted me to, that I&#39;m sure Filipinos understand why parents really want that, then when I had a chance to quit college I just quitted. It&#39;s been 5 years since then and I always say to everyone that I really didn&#39;t regret even a little that I didn&#39;t finish college and have no degree and that I made a right decision (though yes my parents still hope I would finish college)"
"Hi! i&#39;m a filipino and i totally agree with you! and i just wanna share my own story. Since i graduated in highschool my dream was to become a military man, but, my mom forced me not to pursue it because she said she did not want to loose me, i get it she was scared and we all have a soft spot for our mothers so in the end i ended up in college taking up a nursing degree because they said that time it was a &quot;trend&quot;, so i went, to make the long story short i dropped out on my 1st semester, then, they sent me away for another degree again same reason and again after a year i dropped out, and i came back and again after 3 years of BSA I DROPPED out. all 7 years of my life including those years i was hiatus wasted but my grades ain&#39;t bad either my average score in college was 1.5. <br><br>Everyone i know said i was a failure in society everyone including my relatives and friends, they&#39;re asking me why? why did you do that? you have so much potential, you are ruining your fathers image they said, (My father is a CPA/MBA/Consultant btw, and he is a genius graduated 1st in class a valedictorian in highschool a Summa Cum Laude in college it was not hard for him to look for a job in fact jobs are hunting him instead of him hunting them he has his own office in the end. who can fill the shoes of such greatness, too overwhelming for me i&#39;m not him.) you are ruining your own self they said, but i kept silent. but i said to my self why?? because i opened my eyes i saw lots of professional people who are buried in debts, working on a borring job as long as they can day and night just to earn that small wager, too much effort less income, it&#39;s not good mentally, i saw professionals staying at home doing nothing hoping that one day they could land a dream job. but in reality, just like you said too many professionals/college degree holders but there are no job openings.<br><br>So after all that i paused and said to my self from now on i&#39;m gonna live my life my own way and that i figured i was good in driving since we have a car so i thought why not do a job that i love and enjoyed the most so i started driving for other people then when i earned enough cash i was able to buy my own, right now i have 3 vans with 3 drivers i hired in just 2 years, and i was thinking this ain&#39;t enough, so, since i was good in computers why not build my own net cafe shop i started with 5 units right now i have 25 units and right now i&#39;m planning to build my own computer shop selling and fixing stuffs.<br><br>there you have it, all i have is my skill set and i&#39;m proud not going to college and finishing my degree even though i wasted alot of time because i was pressured, they expect me to do great things in their own way but they did not consider my own, they thought it was the best for me but in the end its up to you to decide not your parents not everyone else. so there you have it in order to live your life to the fullest do it in your own way but in a good way...."

"Hi David! I think you said it right. Just this month that I&#39;ve posted and applied online as a foreign English language teacher. And one of the agents replied back and asked if I have the skill in playing the guitar because the employer requires to accept &quot;teacher applicant&quot; that has it. That really surprised me. So terrible that I don&#39;t have that kind of skills. I like and love music and more on listening instrumental sounds like guitar, piano, and sax. And now I really feel disappointed to my self of not learning about it. But I guess I still have the time to make it up. What do you think?"
"I extremely agree what you said. I was so enlightened after I watched the video. Sometimes, it&#39;s really hard for me to think if I will go to college or not. Since their&#39;s a lot of people who became a successful even though they are not a degree holder or did not even experience a college life but they used their skills and their wiser mind to become a successful. That&#39;s what I really I want to my life. I am so thankful, that I was able to watch thia video and made me realise that, not attending in college ia not a hindrance to become a successful and to do what you really want to your life. Thanks for this video. It&#39;s really gives me a motivation to work hard and to focus my skill and not bothering my mind to not go to college. Thank youüòò"
College is fun. They&#39;re teaching our students (maybe in the Philippines) about how small our world is &amp; they instill the &quot;need&quot; of how to make it bigger. The problem with skillful people who earn those so-called lots of money is that they are &quot;boring&quot;.
"i believe if only companies in the Philippines do not require diploma, then i guess you&#39;re right. but sadly, it doesn&#39;t really go like that in here.  Most companies here in the Philippines require applicants  to have at least a degree in order to be qualified even in the lowest possible position. even a wait staff position in a restaurant requires such in order to be qualified. try to check online job hunting sites and see how the recruitment goes. what qualifications they need for an applicant. and make a ratio of those that says &quot;at least college graduate&quot; and those that only require skills. some would say go put up your own business, that doesn&#39;t require a degree. how many of the Filipinos can actually do that?. try to learn some skills, then go abroad, how many Filipinos can actually fly and workabroad? with the number of unemployed filipinos around the archipelago, are there enough job that do not require a degree to accommodate this overwhelming numbers? i am an ex-overseas worker and i worked for a hotel as a waiter. before i got the position, of course i applied for it online. and yes.. as i clicked on the apply button, it automatically showed &quot;at least a graduate of hotel and restaurant management&quot; at the top of the list. after two years.. i came back for good. tried to applied everywhere.. again...  the same requirement shows up. i got the skills... got the education i need... why is it still hard to get a job? considering i already got 4 years of working experience in the hospitality."
how u differ professional job from <br>skilled job....and beside in technical aspect a company require...those pappers to land a job...some of those people you had mention had the resoures with them....now tell me....do bother to think the pride and the happiness would brings you to college earning those degree..not putting away thier sacrifices...fact was its is our culture...some of us wants to be professionals also....and its is also a choice if we wants too...<br>kindly dont encourage us not to do so....i respect your opinion....but here is ....mine...its not the amount we can earn its the pride and happiness we can bring to our parents...that can bring when time comes to age...that with thier hands or our hands reach those pappers a degree...fulfilment and happines...have a good day
problem is if your n√≥t college gradute or finish atleast 2nd yr college most companies here will not accept u..

"I legitimately  admire this guys and i think he has a point guys. maybe not everyone will make a lot of money, but i can guarantee lots of them will :D"
Apprentissage must be revived.  I wanted to do woodworks but wasn&#39;t offered in our high school back in the 1990s. I could have been a violin maker or a sculptor. ‚ù§Ô∏è Your ideas compel. üíïüòèüëç
It&#39;s all about the Skills. Hope I&#39;m not gonna make a mistake by taking the course someone else&#39;s ambition. Oops...
"You&#39;re view is not unorthodox, as others claim. This was my mindset back then and some of the folks I hanged with. Many use this excuse because of pure laziness. I went to college and didn&#39;t finish it, however, I was getting nowhere with my career. Then my dad told me to go back and finish college. He even told me that most this successful guys who didn&#39;t went to uni or college are rare and that I wasn&#39;t one of them. First, I was so offended, but then I went back to it. Now I&#39;m glad I did finish it, I&#39;m working in a job that requires credentials. I guess it depends on the person, but discouraging people to go to college, it think you&#39;re limiting people&#39;s option...besides money is not the only driving force for most Filipinos. Nice try anyways, but It didn&#39;t work for me. PS but I do support revamping the education system."
Ang ganda nito! üëçüèº
"Yep. Totally agree with you. Before I enter college, I already knew that college is not for me. One of the best reason is that I can&#39;t find a college course that really suits what I want. Another thing is that I am not satisfied with the system of schools. But actually, I am at my 2nd year now and still don&#39;t know if I could finish my BS-Education Major in English course. I think the thing is that we as Filipinos traditionally think that it is a satisfaction for us if we graduate on college. Our parents want this and we think that with education, life would be fine. I think it only depends on how people see his life. Key is hardwork and learning as long as we keep our options open to anything. If this way doesn&#39;t for you then you can go the other way around. And keep on trying, doing, creating. That&#39;s it. I totally appreciate your words."
"Mr. DiMuzio, I think you are correct. A lot of Filipinos take Engineering degree in college but there&#39;s no jobs in the Philippines. There are a few positions as an engineer in the government but for only those who have connections."
"I think the problem in the Philippines is that some employers use college degrees to discriminate between applicants which shouldn&#39;t be the case, but like you said, it may be a &quot;safe choice&quot; for them. But I guess having a degree does entail that you may have a certain degree of competence. It&#39;s only here in the US that I have seen more employers actually valuing experience over theory which is in line with what you discussed."
I think the major reasons most of the people who became successful without a college degree is that they love what they are doing and strived harder than the people with bachelors degree.<br><br>Here in the Philippines the first thing most of the companies were looking are the degree of education and what school they have finished the course. So it means a lazy idiot who graduated in a well known school has a greater chance to get hired rather than a highly skilled and well experienced person who doesnt have a diploma. (resume: first stage of elimination)<br><br>Most of the schools teaches you how to become an employee but if you start with yourself you are building your own empire.
"We have the same view in life, I really admire you"
"This guy is full of crap. A degree gives one the opportunity to allow doors to be open.  Reputable companies with high paying jobs will hire people because of what they say regardless of official qualifications. Yeah right! Obviously there are those that made it without one but they are few and far in between and statistics prove otherwise. Professions such as in medicine , engineering, finance, accounting or IT require extensive learning and training in the field. South Korea is economically successful due to its high rate of technical education by their citizens and that includes Japan. Those that did not do well in high school will not be a good candidate to pursue a college degree. However, you are limiting your options and leaving your viability in life to chance or happenstance. What is your claim to fame to give such an ill conceived universal  advice? Do you realize people are individuals and their dreams, ambitions, abilities and aspiration will differ? What professional experience do you have in the field of career counseling nor empirical data to support your statements. Outside of being on YouTube, what have you done worth mentioning? Any field of study college or not."
This is true i am an engineering grad . In the phils i now realize  that i just spent 5years  of my life on waste. I am now a machine operator outside the country i am earning way better than engineer earning in the phils.
"I agree! So true. follow ur heart :D Filipino parents are like this &quot; U should go get this Degree,&quot;  :D"

Totoong totoo to! gusto ko sanang gawin to pero magagalit magulang ko pag di ako nagaral eh. Kasi dito sa amin sa bahay pag may nasisirang gadgets or kahit ano. Sesearch ko lang sa internet at nagagawa ko naman. Dahil doon ko nalaman kung ano talaga ang gusto kong gawin... Pero eto na nga napunta ako sa course na di ko gusto (Public Administration). Which is malayo sa gusto kong gawin na magayos ay di ko magawa kasi gusto nga ng mga magulang ko na makatapos muna ako kasi daw mahalaga daw yon. Kaya eto ako ngayon nagpupursigeng makatapos para maging proud ang mga magulang ko sakin
"Too be honest, it&#39;s true.. it&#39;s reality.<br>As long as you have skills, you will get a good job and earn good"
Shut up! Even here in Canada having a degree plus the skills will give you an edge to the rest of the applicants when looking for a job.
"This is true‚Äî i spent 3 1/2 years theory and only 5 months job training. But where i am now its dif. Because my degree is equal to a skilled job where you can finish in a year.

"I can&#39;t help but drop some lines here. For someone who went to college and actually discovered what he is good at and developed his skills, I think that&#39;s another story. However, if it&#39;s in the field of teaching and education where everyone&#39;s crazy about degrees, qualifications, and where people get their diplomas from, rather than the effectiveness one has in the profession,  Even a 4-year college degree wouldn&#39;t be enough. <br><br>I know of this teacher who wrote a book even without a master&#39;s degree with contents all doctorate levels out there would hate. He can accept that. But it&#39;s the system. People are conditioned that higher degrees = success. He hates it. <br><br>Thanks for this video David!"
your a blessing to mankind. i always wanted to be a singer songwriter model actress comedian but you can die trying right?
Hello sir! You know what here in the Philippines and any other asian culture. Having a DEGREE is somewhat many parents and students take a great great pride of. Even if its a useless degree finishing college is something like a lifetime achievement award that u can be proud of until u die. Did u heard about KC conception an actress here in the Philippines getting her BA degree and the megastar seems to be so proud of it like she won a war. Lol. Many Filipinos believe that whatever fame money or success you have achieved its still nothing and the infamous &quot;it can all be taken away from you but education will remain with you forever &quot; mentality even the diploma they get is good for nothing. Thats how Filipinos take great pride in college degree which is so impractical and delusional. Its the sadly the culture here in Philippines they value a useless printed paper from a corporation than the actual skills and the timeless wisdom that college will never teach. I would like to hear your views about this sir. Thanks
I am a filipino. my brother went college and graduated. filipino should go to college.
I want to go to army but my fam dont want me to.
"This video promoting not to go to college just because for some cases and possibilities that u can actually strive in life even u don&#39;t hold any degree, yeah its true for those people who want to aim some big change in their life those who have determination to do that but still a lot of companies in Philippines looking for job applicants with a certain degree or a title holder without this title they will put LABEL on u, so how can u get a job with well-paid salary if this is the implementation mindset of company your trying to be with, you will force to go to college and make degree and when your done making degree they don&#39;t need u anymore that a sad thing in the Philippines...."

"It&#39;s hard to get a decent job if you&#39;re not college grad. Better to have MBA and even Ph.D. Better to have Harvard MBA and then work at Goldman Sachs. Everything&#39;s easier if you have good school, good grades, good education, wealthy classmates as future connections. Don&#39;t make your life difficult by not studying College."
"You do have a point with university degrees become obsolete given that many people hold them. Yes, it is true that you can watch online videos to learn how to build a house or reassemble a car. <br><br>Sadly, not many people fall into such category. Yes, it is easy to tell someone to watch a video and learn how to build a house, but is that person interested in house building? Same goes with guitar making. You have to be somehow musically inclined to even think of starting a mini-guitar business.<br><br>For the sad part, most are just simple and tend to fall into generic industries like engineering, architecture or even the sciences and maths. Even humanities like Economics and Real-Estate are on the rise. The thing is, you can&#39;t only rely on skills for those.<br><br>It&#39;s true, you can go to college, get a degree, but not have any skills and thus, you don&#39;t get employed. But one can have skills but if your knowledge set doesn&#39;t meet the bare minimum of your company&#39;s requirements, you won&#39;t be employed too. <br><br>The problem is, people tend to make an opposition between degrees and skills. Don&#39;t get me wrong, but it is true that for some cases, you can escape with pure skills especially in the entertainment sector. Personally, I tend to correlate degrees with skills. If your skills are no longer relevant, rely on your degree. And if your degree is irrelevant, rely on your skills.<br><br>There&#39;s nothing wrong with going to university, only the mentality of the person is. I respect your opinion that university is obsolete and really, it would be hard to argue your point if Goldman Sachs corroborates it. <br><br>I think the example I can think of are domestic helpers. For most filipinos, they complete high school and they enter the industry. Yes, they earn money but they tend to be insufficient and that is you having skills as a domestic helper. It&#39;s sad to say this but income is closely related to degree. If you have a degree, you earn more money. Especially in a globalised world, you can&#39;t take risks anymore. Any foreigner can come and steal your job and university degrees are a big target for employers. Say I am a Harvard student, Filipino employers will go crazy on that one feller. <br><br>Personally, I&#39;d encourage entering a university. You won&#39;t know, tertiary education may actually fuel your skills to improve much more. If you have skills in Historical Analysis, maybe tertiary analysis skills may help build up their skill. Really depends on the university. Sadly, state universities are known to only groom you to pick up skills that you can learn in the internet. But try much more advanced schools and a degree education may be the answer to fully develop your skills to its potential."
But in Philippines some company they looking college graduate with hieght...some interviewer they looking the face not the skills..and how you get experience and develop the skills if they will not hired you because no experience or if they look your face not qualify for them applying in Philippines company is difficult need beautiful face and nice height
Depende sa college at degree.
"I completely agree  with every case you&#39;ve presented in this video. I felt that I&#39;ve learned so much more in my first 1.5years worth of actual work experience (I&#39;m on my 8th year in the profession) than the required 5-years of college education plus the hours required before getting the &quot;license&quot;. For me, the degree is only like for &quot;credentials&quot; - but it takes a lot of perseverance, passion and good marketing strategy to up your rep and be a magnet for people who need not only your services but the skill and QUALITY of output you are able to deliver to them."
"If you have a college degree use it to your advantage,be financially wise, in reality you have the advantage from those who don&#39;t have. If you can&#39;t afford college then develop skills, be financially wise too. it&#39;s all a matter of smart living and hard work. I&#39;m still pro college though. We can&#39;t all be artist and entertainers, the world needs business, medical,engineers and medical people to make it run. <br>Would you let a mechanic do your knee surgery?"
yeah you are right. but you can be more competitive or have a chance to get a g√≤od job if youhave a college degree. and education is a very big thing in all filipino families.
I love this &lt;3
Filipinos cant afford to cnd colllege due to financial prblem!!and da person itself is lazy todo self supporting for studies at same tym wrking !is not easy todo task at same period only a few can survive and succeed !but now recent years precisely not Dutertes year excuse me !people r learning to sebd thier children to collge no matter how poor it is  !Good news about fipinos famly everybody is doing da vry best  to finish da studies of thier kids!meaning in da near future we have a bright tomorrow!
I think each of us has unique character and perspectives in life.  For me I believe that education should prioritize.  It&#39;s a ticket for a future.  But if you are super intellegent and has ability to carry the world then Go what ever life you want in order to succeed.
"Always a pleasure to hear your insights David!  I would perhaps add that 1) while there are who were successful, I could guess the failures outnumber them, maybe 10:1; 2) I think it is ideal to have a reason to forego college, like an idea or a passion and that focus on that outweighs college and; 3) maybe there is also a need to shift college curriculum into more practical useful work skills and hence make &quot;college&quot; as the launch pad for a career as opposed to a 4-year diploma requirement."
"Interesting video. I respect your opinion however I wouldn&#39;t really &quot;encourage&quot; someone to NOT go to college. Truth is that there are absolutely more job opportunities for those with college degrees especially in the Philippines. I don&#39;t think college is for everyone but at the same time I wouldn&#39;t discourage anyone from going. I believe poorer countries such as the Philippines should create more jobs that don&#39;t require college degrees. It&#39;s really sad how to be a Starbucks barista back home, one should have college experience or to be a flight attendant you have to have a college degree on top of all the other crazy requirements. I think a huge factor why the unemployment rate is significantly high in the Philippines is not because people don&#39;t want to work. These people do want to work but most jobs require a college degree. Having lived all my life in the Philippines til I was 23, I know what a huge difference this makes. Both jobs I got here in the US, one for the government and one in the airline industry, did not require college degree. The problem isn&#39;t college. It&#39;s the lack of opportunities for those people who WANT to work but hindered by these crazy-ass requirements. College isn&#39;t for everyone but it should at least be an option. You don&#39;t go to college just to earn a diploma. You also go for the experience, the people you meet, and the things you learn along the way. It&#39;s also a great fallback when things don&#39;t work out. It&#39;s easy to say focus on a skill and work on it but in reality that isn&#39;t the most practical advice especially when you are addressing a country with such high poverty rate. Like how can you work on a skill, let&#39;s say you want to be an amazing digital artist, how can you work on that skill when you can&#39;t even buy a computer or when the only thing that&#39;s on your mind the entire day is finding ways to buy food to get you by another miserable day. We need to create more opportunities for people to earn money and let&#39;s get rid of that &quot;college degree only&quot; requirement. When we implement this, it will allow people to focus on things other than their next meal or where &quot;mangungutang&quot; next for college tuition and then that guy who wants to become an amazing digital artist could afford to buy his laptop, watch tutorials on youtube, and then if he wants to further his studies, he will have the option to save money for school and if he decides to go a different path, that&#39;s also fine. Also don&#39;t go to college blindfolded and don&#39;t go to college because you feel like it&#39;s the only way, everyone else is doing it, or your parents asked you to. Have a purpose other than just getting a diploma."
Yeah I believe at some point.
"N LEARN ONLINE WHAT FOR TO GO TO COLLEGE,  I WAS INSPIRED BY YOU...THANKS.."
"Hahaha You are absolutely right, But It does&#39;nt mean that I am against to those who are studying college as of right now. I am just 18 years old I am from PH I ve just stoped my studies in college I started working a Job as a call center but right now I am one the managers already while my classmates are still there, doing stuffs in the schools . Haha"
That is your values because you are not Asian. Education is wealth that no one can take from you. I guess cause you are of certain heritage that don‚Äôt put value in education. You give the worst advice. You devalue education cause you probably don‚Äôt have a good education.
If you think a college education is expensive try ignorance. The greatest education is failure and learn from it.
"I have a very specific set of skills, Skills that I have acquired over the years.....-Taken"
College education is designed to put and let us work to the industrial and corporate   world which would not help us become financially free. The need for us get a skill and become master is practical.
filipinos..even not go collaged is already intelligent people..that country is nice lovely people kindness and most of all respectful......yahoooo...im coming thier....soon..
ohhh the sounds cold
"...when i was in college, i was one of the best students... i remember wasting my time memorizing every terms on my notebook to pass every exams. . useless. if only i could turn back the time. haha"
now i had idea what i want to do...
Why go to school if you have the internet all you need is a smartphone google can answer all...
"If you do not have what it takes to go to college, someone should not go. But the people who are capable and will benefit in a college education in the field of engineering, healthcare, logistics, navigation etc etc. should have no reason why they shouldn&#39;t go. But the government should have options for those who doesnt have what it takes to go to college. Like what they have in Austria and Germany where people can have a diploma by completing a three year training in a company as an electrician, as mechatronics, as metal worker etc."
I remember one of my bitter moments when applying job was when the agency told me i can work on dunkin donut to sell as crew because i have 4 yr degree. hehe.
All I said is correct go to college is just a wast of time.
Totally agree.
We go college beacuse of that diploma
"Your statement are true and I agree. Most of the college graduates are unemployed, underemployed or if they employ most of them are not related in baccalaureate degree.<br><br>I&#39;m the one whose related that.... college graduate but still looking for a job.... because of job mismatch."
Man! I&#39;ve waited too long for videos like this on youtube! I dont know why Filipinos are so into College! Why?
You&#39;re right! But finishing college is a requirement for getting a job just incase you fail in making money doing your own business. Not everybody is guaranteed to have his/her own business... but have families to feed. And not all skills make good money. Shall we just shut down the universities and colleges?
"You are right,  My boys are in College but the classes that the professor wants them to take , its not reflect on the flieds that they want to study .So my oldest son wants to study of how to built a computer thru Youtube , And now He built his computer and fir his brother. Which is amazing..Thank you fir Sharing your video ,Mabuhay !"
"David! I have to download this video of yours so I could show it to my mom&#39;s high school students. Even though studying in the Philippines is free but still, it requires money to access it and most of them cannot afford it. This video could be their motivation that it is not the end of the road for their dream careers."
"Yes your right skills is what you need but there are to many skilled people here in our country that knows blue collar jobs ,College degree is one of the requirements to have a good paying job here in the Philippines if you don&#39;t have a degree you can&#39;t even have a job. do you know how much a blue collar job earns here? They have the lowest salary and the hardest work.maybe in the US blue collar jobs pay good money but here is different unless you have lots of money and make a business of your own only them you can even think of getting out of college"
"This is very true! I wanted to create a video like this. If I can just reverse time, I will not go to school, like ever, not even high school, I would learn how to read and write Filipino and English. After that everything else that they teach at a school, where you need money, can be learned online FOR FREE! ABSOLUTELY FREE! Man, I learned the deepest math online, math that nobody taught me in college. I learned science that only people like me know about. I dropped out at college when our family didn&#39;t have enough money. I wasted a lot of money and time on my college education, for nothing. I dropped out in 2017 and I was only able to finish 2 years. now I work as a software engineer making money while doing what I love and while learning what I want to learn. Guess what, even though I went to college, I can say that I am self-taught, I learned through online courses, blog posts, videos, etc. 99% of what I know today, is because of the internet. 1% is because of the people around me. I owned my learning and that was actually great, now I don&#39;t need a teacher or professor to teach me anything, I can learn it myself through research."
"In my case, I knew I didn&#39;t need a degree for an entertainment career. EVERYONE SAW ME AS A LOST CASE. I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t waste my time studying something I didn&#39;t care about for 3 or 4 yrs, and now EVERYONE understands! Great video, David! Tell it how it is!"
"If you know the Mike Rowe&#39;s show before,  DIRTY JOBS, he tackled about the &quot;importance of skills,and  skilled workers. And it discussed if getting a degree is still worth of ur time and money."
My wife is filipina she graduated in mathematics and computers she doesn‚Äôt even use her degrees but now she‚Äôs going back to university to do a teaching degree
You&#39;re genuies!
"that only applies to skill jobs but for professional jobs like doctors, teachers, etc that require license they still have to go to college.... if everyone doesn&#39;t go to college like what you&#39;re saying then what do you think will happen to our country in general??????"
"somewhat true but not applicable to all industries. if I&#39;d be an entrepreneur i won&#39;t require a  college degree. but here in the Ph, college diploma is just equivalent of a hischool degree in the US. how i wish our govt would improve the quality of our public secondary educ esp in the provinces."
There is not much to do for this kids so <br>Going to school will make their wiser
"Hi David, am sorry I don&#39;t totally agree nor disagree with your topics. College Education and Skills are all acquired and practiced thru time to be proficient. There are so many unemployed College and Vocational Grads in the Philippines because of the lack of opportunities to acquire skills, meaning no vacancies to be filled for such  jobs. A College or a Vocational Course Grad has the theories and disciplines of a particular curriculum taken but still a greenhorn when it comes to practicing it to hone skills, so one must not stop seeking opportunities. Being said that, it doesn&#39;t necessarily follows that US PILIPINOS should not go to college, its ridiculous, illogical and ill-advise. Just because a few uneducated persons became successful, and just because some  college grads can&#39;t find jobs, then your advise is not to go to college anymore, that&#39;s , sorry to say this, a very moronic point of view. Pilipinos try to pursue and finish College not only because of the Degree and Title but also the salaries that commensurate it. Parents will even break their backs just to see their children finish college. Just compare the salary of an Engineer to that of a SKILLED  carpenter and you can see the logical reason why Pilipinos want to go to College. Higher salaries means a way of uplifting or upgrading one&#39;s status in life.  I agree with you that SKILLS are very important,  but not only to salaried jobs but also to everyday lives like, house chores, and driving vehicles to name a few, even more so on being self-employed. But PLEASE DON&#39;T DISCOURAGE PILIPINOS TO PURSUE COLLEGE, &#39;coz like music, education is part and parcel of Pilipino culture. All the Philippine Government has to do is to open up and lure local and/or foreign investors to create jobs. Education is not an OBSOLETE thing, it&#39;s a LIFETIME commitment. Both college degrees and technical skills of the Pilipinos made them excel and envied by some countries especially our OFW&#39;s, they can be at par if not even surpass western peoples. If one cannot pursue and finish college for one reason or the other then deviate to other possibilities that could make one skillful and be productive, instead of discouraging them not to go to college, if that is so, then tell the Government to let all the colleges and universities be closed forever, if you think its the best solution.  Which I think more than absurd, meaningless and pointless. <br>Mga kabayan, hindi ko gusto ang inuugali nitong dayuhan na ito sa kanyang mga sinasabi eh, naka ilang panahon lang siya dito sa atin eh akala mo siya na ang pinaka magaling magpayo tungkol sa buhay natin. Noong una hinangaan ko siya sa pagkanta ng mga awitin natin, pero ngaun kung pinapayuhan nya tayong mga Pinoy na huwag nang magaral o magtapos ng  kolehiyo na parang bagang siya ay isang dalubhasa sa ekonomiya natin, eh gayung isa rin yta siyang hindi nkapagtapos eh para bagang binababoy at minamaliit niya tau. At iyan ay hindi ko gusto. Maaaring may kaunti siyang punto ngunit hindi nangangahulugan tama na ang lahat ng sinabi nya. Masama loob ko kapag tinatapakan ang ating bansa&#39;t mga kababayan eh, dayuhan man siya o hindi. Mahal ko ang bansa natin ano man ang kakulangan nito. Wala nman perpektong bayan o gobyerno eh."
Liam Neeson has particular sets of skills
You&#39;re hit it on skill.
I totally agree on this point. Like for example my brother is IT and he never finish college. He went to 4 different schools already but still drop out. Then i took a 2 yrs course in college. My younger sister is a license nurse. It really depends of your skills or shall i say ability to do something. My brother never finish college but he earn 40-50k pesos a month thru internet. I earn 70-80k pesos thru my work. And my sister who is a Nurse who works here in the Philippines earns 10-15k php. Me and my brother earns more than my younger sister who studied  4 yrs in college. So college is not really important not unless your planning to be a doctor or a engineer.
"Absolutely true. Coz all the lessons you will learn in  4 years in collage,  80% will not be put to used. IN MY OPINION coz right now I&#39;m still waiting for the time where I can apply those x &amp; y variables that I learn in Math &amp; some other things.üòä"
: ) Yahhh Go K12.. nice one David..
you are liar mostly pilipino is going college only carabao in the Philippines is not going in college.
What is your profession?
Bright idea man haha you nailed it! I think skilled workers in the our country should get paid more so more guys can go have a papers to techinical schools instead.Trades back home were pretty much neglected and not very many were interested either unless it will benefit on them to apply to other country.<br>Great video I enjoyed it
"It think this is a case to case basis<br>I&#39;m a a cook and love what I do but one regret that I have is not taking the classes seriously when I was in college, some of those classes will be helpful in the future like math, basic business management, accounting,englis, computer classes etc. I realize this now why they include this subject in my degree. Now that I&#39;m planing to open my own business."
bullshit filipinos need college we are not like america
"I agree ! College education in most cases is a complete waste of time ! especially in the Philipines. Why not be like the Chinese in the Philippines ? They don&#39;t always get a college education. They start their own business and the Filipinos work for them ! Spending 4 years in college just to get a piece of paper that basically  says, &quot; I know how to do it ! &quot; is hogwash ! Most of the time the paper is a lie ! They don&#39;t know shit ! They spent time and effort to get a worthless piece paper. I know a friend who was tricked into marriage with a Filipina who wanted badly to marry an American. I knew he wouldn&#39;t return to the USA still single. She bragged that she got a diploma in a Phillipine college for &quot; Batchelor&#39;s degree in Hotel Management&quot; ! What do you think that piece of paper is worth ? Besides, many girls go to college so they can brag they graduated but end up being raped or seduced in college and end up pregnant -- very very often ! There goes their &quot;successful&quot; future ! Even if they get a college &quot;education&quot;, the girls value more at the chance of marrying an American. Sometimes to get to that , they give their bodies up for sale in Olongapo, Subic Bay, or Angeles City hoping to get an American in love with them. And they don&#39;t. But end up as whores."
Sorry i dont agree
"Sorry, but this sounds so naive. The point of college is to develop skills and to have those skills &quot;certified.&quot; In the real world, jobs don&#39;t just pop up because you have skills, you have to compete against others who have degrees and are also skilled (probably more skilled if they actually applied themselves during college). You got lucky, and the people you&#39;ve made as examples were lucky and/or were privileged and talented. Not everyone is that. Most people aren&#39;t that."
"I agree with what you have said...the problem is in this cruel world, some are discriminative to those who didn&#39;t go to college..."
"You are right.  This is a huge eye-opener.  Looking back in hindsight, I wish I&#39;ve invested in acquiring skills that matter to me and I&#39;m passionate about instead of getting a college degree.  It is instilled in the Filipino mindset and culture that good education = stable job = success but that is farther from the truth.  After getting a degree in Computer Engineering, I still struggled in getting hired because I don&#39;t have the necessary skill set and experience to immediately work in the industry.  Even if I had already learned this bitter truth back then, it would&#39;ve been still difficult to change the mind of typical Filipino parents such as mine about College education.  Thank you for sharing this, David.  You just inspired me to go after my dreams and make money out of what I&#39;m really good at."
You&#39;re absolutely right.
its  the truth listen  to him thank       you
"I respect your opinion. However, with the kind of life and economy right here together with all those traditions from the old times that we still practice right now, we cannot deal with the &quot;real world&quot; if we are not college graduates. We have so much skills but white collar job earns much more than jobs that just requires just skills. Plus, the fact that you cannot be hired with just highschool diploma. I think education is really a must here plus we do need to be more competetive nowadays. Our country lacks innovation unlike the first world countries. The youth right now just like what Jose Rizal ( our national hero) said is the hope of our country. Producing quality, productive and competetive graduates will lead us to become a first world country too. If you&#39;ll go and see younger generation here and see what the uneducated or rather unable to go to school ones do with their lives, you&#39;ll clearly see what i mean.<br> EDUCATION = LIFETIME SECURITY"
"This is the kind of western mentality that causes you to loose your job to immigrants. I&#39;m in Canada a lot of locals who lost their jobs not knowing why they lost their jobs to immigrants. You know why? They learned their skills in high school only and went straight to work to cash in some checks and the immigrants have bachelors degree, obviously who have more skills? And a lot of locals here who have huge titles and lost their jobs to immigrants who does not have titles but have more skills, why? Because we know the value of education and we take advantage on the opportunity learn? It&#39;s not just a diploma it is attestation of the wisdom and skills that you earned from your studies and those who graduated and still do not have skills it is because they think that it is just a diploma.Your video is misleading everyone. You are sighting bill gates, steve jobs etc. Guess what these people were in the right place at the right time and exceptionally intellegent? You are speaking about what less than 1% of the population? What is the population of the philippines. Finding jobs in a country like philippines where supply and demand applies and where sadly discremnation applies too. Your principles applies to those who do not have even a slightest chance of going to college. Do not add to the already confused generation."
While I do believe that everything has a risk to it. May it be going or not going to college.<br>Thank you for showing that the college path isn&#39;t the only path to take. I hope someone out there that has an amazing talent or skill will be convinced to cultivate that skill and end up to be something amazing.
"I agree mate, I love what I do and im not really fond of my college days. Not much was learnt in school. Most of my learnings  was from net and books. But for an archi person its a bit sad,  because we need it for the board but back then, the archi board never existed during the time of  walter gropius and frank floyd wright."
"If companies wouldnt require college degrees then i wouldnt,i already <a href=""http://finished.college/"">finished.college</a> and i still wanna do more üòâ thanks for the video, very informative, i believe this applies to countries with a diff culture, but growing up as a filipino made me think that it is necessary üòâüòò"
"To each his own. My fate is different from your faith. Your skills is more innate in you and you have all the means to pursue it. What about those people who wants a career that really needs credentials, but you try to convince them not to go to college just because they have good skills in pottery?  I am not contradicting you, I am just wearing my black hat."
"im so amazed at your videos I apparently subscribe to it, I felt enlighten &amp; Disappointed, i crave to have a life like yours, it just so hard for me to have your mindset because your not born in a 3rdworld countries like ours,  western countries have better choices in life, more freedom and resources, ...   Pinoys who dont go to collage gets abuse by companies &amp; have the dirtiest of jobs, i hope to have a luck in life like yourss.. thank u"
"Hi David! - Remember me? <br><br>I agree 100%! - It&#39;s all about skills! <br><br>In my experience, I learn more in High School than in College. :)<br><br>Nowadays, Degree/Diploma is just a piece of paper.<br><br>In fact, my plan for my kids is to go to conventional school only up until High School. After that, I will ask them what they really want to do or what interests them most in life. Then, I&#39;ll guide or help them find great online or hands on courses that will help them acquire and develop skills. More than anything else, work and life skills. <br><br>It&#39;s not WHAT YOU KNOW that will make a difference. It&#39;s  WHAT YOU CAN DO!<br>Of course, it&#39;s good if you know a lot. However, knowledge is useless if you don&#39;t put it into action nor apply it to something useful.<br><br>If I have to choose between skills and knowledge, then I would choose skills without thinking twice. :)<br>However, I feel so  blessed that I don&#39;t need to choose. :) (modesty aside, just for fun and bragging not intended)"
Im with you on this David! even Robert Kiyosaki would say this you know! Keep up the good work for helping us to educate our kababayans! I&#39;m a teacher by profession teaching overseas now however this is not a guarantee as well!
YOU INSPIRED ME WITH THAT KIND OF &quot;MIND BLOWING CONCEPT&quot;...I HAVEN&#39;T HEARD THAT BEFORE BUT IT IS LOGICAL...MAKING MORE SENSE THAN EVER!
"I agree, at least the pretty girls should not go to college ... they should all become prostitutes."
"College now is a crap... When you go to college here in Philippines they have some Subjects not relevant to your chosen course, they just making money out of it, also waste of time... I don&#39;t know in K to 12 now..."
"Another thing, the whole Philippine government, employment system, &quot;education&quot;, and everything else needs a HUGE make-over. Totally and completely need to be reversed for good! As we all know Filipino tradition, culture, its society &quot;norm&quot;, and for the most part the Government leaders are corrupt ! It seems impossible for a CHANGE but it&#39;s not ! <br>There is always something that someone can do to help his/her situation. They can start out with this...It&#39;s the people that needs to change, each individuals have to be responsible also to themselves, instead of blaming their situation to other people or the government.<br><br>They should start with their THOUGHTS, their mindset, then take ACTION, that&#39;s it. I have also read a book named CHANGE YOUR THOUGHTS, CHANGE YOUR LIFE. And little by little, I&#39;ve applied what I&#39;ve learned from that book, and I can say that, slowly but surely it&#39;s working for me, too."
"I think and I have a feeling that David have also read the book (Rich Dad Poor Dad) of Robert Kiyosaki, one of the famous rich investor and entrepreneur here in the U.S. <br>He was in the military, a U.S. Army helicoper pilot during the Vietnam war. After his tour of duty and contract in the Army, he decided that he wanted to become an entrepreneur, but did not pursue his COLLEGE EDUCATION. Instead, he invested his time, savings, and effort on a lot of EDUCATION in FINANCIAL and INVESTING. <br><br>What he did was study on his own, and attended all these seminars about financial, investing, and small business lessons. Whatever he could lay his hands on and set his mind to to learn, he&#39;s done it all. You may read that book RICH DAD POOR DAD if you guys are interested with his entire story.<br>He also pointed out and explained (in the book) that to become very successful and rich or prosperous in life, you must first need to invest in FINANCIAL EDUCATION and SKILLS that you can use to achieve your goals. You don&#39;t really need a COLLEGE DEGREE in order for you to become successful in life.<br>College education is good for us all but it&#39;s not really necessary. If you are hardworking, smart, and wise enough, it&#39;s not impossible to achieve your dream to have that FINANCIAL FREEDOM.  And also he pointed out that good habits, and self-discipline will help you a lot, in order for you to succeed on your chosen &quot;field&quot;.<br><br>Positivity, hard work, dedication and enthusiasm is what makes the difference, really. And there are no SHORT CUTS, either.  All that are also mentioned in his book. I suggest to people here that have the same mindset with David DiMuzio, do read books like RICH DAD POOR DAD by Robert Kiyosaki or NO EXCUSES (The Power of Self-Discipline) by Brian Tracy. <br>I can guarantee you, if you read either one or both of this 2 books, it will change your mindset about money, success and it will help you to become a better person, fullfill your dreams, and live a happy, financially-free life. And you&#39;ll be glad you did.<br>The main moral lesson of my comments and message is, you don&#39;t need to have a whole lot of money to do what Robert Kiyosaki and David did. This is achievable for everyone. Anyone can start from &quot;scratch&quot; and work your way up until you achieve your goals and succeed, that&#39;s it !"
"You can speak about Americans you know better about your people. As you said it applies to all nationalities, so do not use the Philippine flag."
You can now learn everything on the internet &amp; with some experience you can still make a lot of money. Although most companies in US &amp; PH still ask for diplomas.
"Very true. I agree. Nurses nowadays for example, though not applicable to all, if they don&#39;t find a job will either work as a medical transcriptionist or work as a call center agent."
It&#39;s a fallacy to apply your experience to the population at large.<br>REPLY
"Hope to meet you in person. I admire your views on life. What you said is been applied in my life, but I need more discipline :-) and need people like you as a mentor."
True in the west. Kind of in doubt about Philippines tho
"Hi david,,,your are  right,,,my son 23 yrs old,not graduated in elem,but he can fix motorcycle,,thats her natural ability to  fix ,,he work at ducati ,,,went to malaysia for the compition of her boss ,,"
Thank you sir. I will apply your advice to myself. I can cook and i will sell it.
We are  on the same page....love it..
Thank you so much David. This really helped a lot.
"Yes Sir! I know what you meant, i only done 6 grades but my boss always told me that I do better than my college graduate crew workers, and got more experience because I‚Äôm always wants to learn something and not afraid to try it..."
I am a college graduate and also a skilled technician. its helps me a lot in my job and it is an advantage to others because i can do both office works and technical works at the same time.
I was reluctant to watch your video because of the title used. but I&#39;m glad I did. I totally agree with you about developing one&#39;s skill set. great video sir!
Vocational skills that&#39;s the answer
Thank you for sharing your inspirational videos. It just shows you care. I hated college. What a waste of time and that was four years. Just wish government would put more money on skill  building programs for Filipinos.
You are so right. Thank you for sharing your opinion about having to finish collage degree. I think if you work whatever skill you had you are more ahead than the people who is in collage. the greatest teacher in your life is your own experience that you learn.
Practically true.. there are a lot of professional Filipino that are working outside their degree.
"Ouch!,,, True!"
"Thank you very much david for your good advice that almost goes into my bone and really appreciated, everything you say is right. May God always guide you..."
"I completely agree with you 100% college here is absolutely waste of time, you spend 4 years just to get that piece of paper called dipola lol, its actually ridiculous.  But here in the Philippines, we need to go to college to have a diploma, we need diploma to have decent high paying jobs, not going to college is not an option for us Filipinos it&#39;s a necessity, our country being a 3rd world country we need them diplomas in order to apply for jobs, because being an undergraduate, your choice of job is very limited. My options would just be maybe a call center agent or maybe a food service crew. We need to go to college because we need to apply for high paying jobs to provide for our families."
True! We need skill not degree..!
sabi nga ni alexonze yung college diploma natin eh nangunguhulugan lang na certified alipin na tayu. tinuturuan tayu kung paano maging magaling na employee at hindi kung paano maging finacially free.
This has been my mindset ever since in the 90&#39;s which is why i chose to go to a humble college    institution instead of those fancy universities.Schools never taught skills but theories and all that crap.cheers!
"That&#39;s true however if you&#39;re a kid in a 3rd world country with not even a hundred dollars to your name, a family to think of and feed, you&#39;re still better off getting that degree. Whether it&#39;s an AB or BS, your chances of landing a job in a competitive corporate world is better than those who doesn&#39;t have one"
I actually agree with that.  Sometimes all we need is some kind of trade and/or vocational education.  I agree!
üí≤‚ù§
"I really agree to your videos regarding filipinos and financial literacy. For me, getting a degree is fine as long as you know financial literacy. You can even get education and manage your business at the same time especially now that online business is a trend üòä the thing is you should always always learn how to handle money and follow your dream, no matter what. I&#39;m a filipina and I do both graduate study (outside Philippines thru scholarship) and 3 small businesses in philippines.. save, save, then invest üòÄ"
I always knew having a college degree is to an extent useless.. but hey... you get to meet people there to make a  jump start to whatever business you&#39;re planning...
"i agree, a vocational course or a 2 year course is much better, less time consuming and skilled centered, most of the 4 year courses has alot of additional unnecessary subjects just to streched the years and its so frustrating and disappointing"
SOOOOOO TRUUUUUUEEEEE!!!
look bruh ...we are not like any other race that even dont their history!!
Another video with David dropping some more TRUTH BOMBS!
"I feel like I`ve read a book similar to what you just said, written by Napoleon Hill. Anyways this is true at some point."
this is true. seems like the new trend in the world right now is skill specialization.
"Certainly there are decent good paying jobs out there that doesn&#39;t require formal training or a college degree.  One can teach him or herself through trial and error or be an apprentice for how long it takes to be good at it to make a living.  Some jobs require a year or two of schooling and not just hands on training.  That&#39;s why some people attend vocational schools.  And of there are jobs,careers, professions that require more years of training and learning.  You need to master and know the answer(s) of what,why, and how... Face to face interaction with you teachers and peers is a must most of the time.  The most important thing is you alone must decide what&#39;s good for you and would love and enjoy for the rest of your working life."
<b>&quot;Skillshare&quot;</b> is a good online learning website.
"There are people commenting here without even understanding what David said.  Please listen carefully to what David is saying before commenting.  By the way, listening is a skill - and you can develop that even without going to college!"
"This reminds me of what Mike Rowe&#39;s opinion here: <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=CVEuPmVAb8o"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=CVEuPmVAb8o</a>"
I agree! 100% ive learned a lot from videos from YouTube I went and got a degree on for a couple of trades most of what I&#39;ve learned can be found online and some stuff didnt even get covered when I went too school.
"I adore your music David, I really do."
The internet can give you more than the school but other jobs requires college degrees.
"You can only choose not to go to COLLEGE if you want to have, have a risky future. if your family cant afford it, if you dont have time, if you dont aim that high, or maybe even if you want an unsteady income. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo3As36trkA&amp;t=03m59s"">03:59</a> How can you learn how to assemble a car, learn  how to build a house when you dont have the knowledge of these things? Oh youtube? Lynda? Lynda isnt even for free ROFL In real world? Lets be real here, if I will be working all I wanna do with my freetime is to spend that and have some alone time. Why would I want to teach someone when I can just use that to get some rest? Im not saying that its impossible but brah this is real life.<br>Just because a lot of successful people didnt went to college, doesnt mean we have to follow their footsteps. <br>What is valuable? To have a higher knowledge inoder to apply it and to overcome your future opponent. Skill? I¬¥m sure they can ALSO teach us that in College. <br>To contribute your skill in a company, you have to work (ofc), but how can you work if maybe no one will accept you. I¬¥m not being negative but lets face the truth the demands on the job market is reasonably high that you should consider having a higher educational degree inorder just to have a work. Infact they might have to replace mankind with robots so how are you going to outskill a robot?"
"Verywell said David!<br>In my case its very hard to find job in PH, thats the reason why im here in KSA. I decided to apply as Goverment officer unfortunately, it requires College Degree I finish 2 two year courses (CSNT and HRS)<br>But they said it should be 4 year course im so Disappointed that I cant apply as a Police especialy now that im already 30 yo. Thank you Mr. David this video make feel comfortable nowüòä<br>Godbless!"
I&#39;m a filipino and I adore you. I like your unorthodox mindset. I hope one day I can meet you personally to listen on you more. Please continue giving lessons and videos like this to us filipinos. I&#39;d like to be your friend also if a chance is given üòÇ
i just want to ask what is your business or what is your source of living
"Fair enough. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Specific"">#Specific</a> skill can create enormous wealth. Thanks David."
"I&#39;ve personally wanted to make a music career too and focus on that (and I still do) but most people taught<br>me that getting a college degree is the only way to compete in this world (or more like in the Philippines)<br>because I think the SAD TRUTH is, the filipinos don&#39;t get much opportunities here if you don&#39;t have a college<br>degree (which is something you should look into, Mr. David). It even happened in the city I&#39;m at that a company hired someone with a college degree and did not hire someone who had the skill and talent for the job (but did not have a degree). Though point taken. I still think you&#39;re right, but there are so many factors to cover why it&#39;s a long shot to not go to college for Filipinos."
True. I&#39;m a nursing grad and i hate it now and I&#39;m not using it.
"If only things goes that way, no certificate, no diploma and no college degree required only the skills and talents maybe its easy for us to seek opportunity here in Philippines. But its sad to say things isn&#39;t goes that way. We need to store knowledge, learning foreign culture , we need to learn and speak english language so that we can interact not only here in local but also in foreign people. How to achieve that? We should send to school. Because highschool graduate is not really enough here in the Philippines, unless you have especial talent and skill that can standout, but then it&#39;s hard to seek that opportunity and it takes long time for us to do that. So before its too late for you, you should send to school for you to have two options, when you fail by using your talent you have a second option and that is your knowledge you gain in your college degree."
That&#39;s why i preferred TVL course than the major one&#39;s
clickbait?
"Many of the most successful people in history didn&#39;t go to college, . People like Andrew Carnegie, Benjamin Franklin, Richard Branson. The list goes on and on. They however grew up in a time when a college education was much more necessary to learn. These days a college education is almost obsolete as a necessary learning tool except for a very select few degrees (medicine, law ...etc.).<br><br>Especially in the Philippines where college degrees are a dime a dozen one must set themselves apart as having truly valuable and unique skills in order to succeed in a career they love. The more valuable skills you possess the happier you&#39;ll also be. When people value your skills and expertise it leads to more enjoyment in your career.<br><br>Though it&#39;s free to gain the knowledge needed for most valuable expertise it takes a lot of time and practice to learn them, which is why they are so valuable and rare. In most cases college doesn&#39;t teach you to practice the skills needed to impart value. College mainly just teaches you how to go to college, which is not a valuable skill. <br><br>Where are the best psychology, singing, music, real estate, math, engineering, and building teachers in the world? They are on YouTube or <a href=""http://lynda.com/"">Lynda.com</a> teaching for free or for very little cost. They are also out in the real world doing their jobs where you can go find them and if you&#39;re willing to dedicate a large amount of your time and attention you can become their personal student.<br><br>PS: I made a disclosure about medical degrees at the beginning of the video. ...but because people have asked... Yes, I would happily let someone perform an internal surgery on me without a college degree. I&#39;ve had many surgeries done and never asked the surgeon where he went to college ...did you? Do you know where every doctor you&#39;ve ever visited has gone to college? Do you check to see what grades they got in college before listening to their medical advice? I care about someone&#39;s abilities, knowledge and experience. That&#39;s it.<br><br>I would never suggest someone just drop out of college or don&#39;t go to college because they should just work. I suggest that people don&#39;t go to college and INSTEAD spend excessive amounts of time accumulating rare and valuable skills. Many of which can not be learned very directly or efficiently at college. <br><br>Before you tell me I&#39;m wrong I have a question ...What skills do you have that you are world class at? Meaning you are in the top 10% of the best in the world. No matter what country you live in if you are world class at any useful skill and continue learning, growing and evolving that skill you will always have a great job, no need for a college degree."

I know something cheaper and good quality service barber shop in Davao Philippines. Just 25 pesos but super amazing skill of thier barbers
it mostly depends on the barber i get my haircut on brunos also but not on cebu bc
that girl English speaking very well   :)
I know it&#39;s expensive in Bruno&#39;s HaircutüòÇ
35 pesos is better only need edge up
Its the same so I guess you just go to the 35 pesos with same outcome with massage.
"250 php is okay if you have deeper pocket. 35 php is provincial price in Manila it is 50 php, Price varies depending on the barbershop location"
haircut costs 20 pesos in my place and they&#39;re good barbers
I am from Cebu city..Enjoy here the both of you my friend heheh
dude the 250 for philipinos thats girl thing.. the 35 is for guys  :-)
Im sorry but that EXO&#39;s mask tough
"I used to have a haircut in brunos bgc, manila<br>I actually dont like it. They dont really know what is the best haircut for you.  The barbers outside are better."
The best is 35 pesos and my haircut is faded (zero) then devil cut
Both are great.
Go in salon along the streets and far better if u found gays working nearby surely you&#39;ll be satisfied with styles u need.
There&#39;s no difference at all except the price! Go for the cheaper cut!
P35.00 though.. ^^
70
OMG his so cute
35php best
I think  i choose the first one but its different style much better if they have ssme cut
Me as Pinoy i prefer to go to 35pesos hair cut coz most of the good barbers is in the the cheapest Barber shop üòä
The same bro ..both are the same both lookin good.
"Philippines have the cheapest hair cut in the world . And the one more I like so much , is the barber cut . Remember barbers cut of the pinoys !!!"
It depends all tho both look what u asked for so its all good
$0.70 HAIRCUT IS THE BEST MEEN!
Go to ‚Äúbakla‚Äù they‚Äôll give you free haircuts every time
If you want to get a nice hair cut in the Philippines choose a young barber they are the good barbers and hair stylist in the Philippines.
Pierre you did not cut your hair too short that is why it did not looks nice. Anyways next time make cut it short.
Your friend is handsome now with his new hair cut.
The best hair cut is the 35 pesos
35 pesos won

BRUNO&#39;S!!! THATS WHERE MY DAD GETS HIS DAILY HAIRCUT IDK WHY
there is also a 7 or 8 peso haircut my brother tried it and it looked so good
I would pay 250 for the 35 hair cut... LOL
"For me i like the 35 Peso haircut more, because the hair is shorter and both of the haircuts are made well. With the 250 Peso haircut you have to return to the barber shop after 3 weeks, the 35 Peso haircut lasts easily for more than one month. Even if the price would have been the same, i prefer the first haircut, which we have seen here for 35 Peso."
I go for P35 pesos
35 php .. hehehe
Its not about on the amount that youve paid is about how professional barbers is
T es fran√ßais c&#39;est sur üòÇüòÇ
On est la
Exo mask üòÇ cool
Fran√ßais?
Both are bad jheez
I don‚Äôt even get the razor for a 20$ haircut
I got a free haircut before from my grandma üëµüèº..
anybody noticed that girl nerves ??
Cheap is always better.
The second one would be like 15 pounds in the uk
Und in Deutschland f√ºr M√§nner 20‚Ç¨ bruhh
Hey pierre u want to come out heree
Cheap
Surigao Cityyyyy!!!!
Wow no fade or shape up at all this is depressing
They both weak
"Damn that 70cent haircut was tight, really impressive"
"It depends on what you preffer actually,"
My haircut is ‚Ç¨17 and I‚Äôm twelve so ye Ireland is more expensive then the Philippines
Magaling ang pnoy jan..
.7 cents he blessed u
honestly bruno&quot;s sucks
"They only took longer for him at the $0.70 because they know you are a foreigner so they do their best so you tip them. Every barber shop on the street in like any city in the Philippines knows and cuts peoples hair the same, go to another shop in a different city in the philippines, they will cut your hair the same."
35php haircut won in my opinion. It looks neat and it was done in my hometown surigao city. Lol
Bruh 5 dollars I pay like 50
Both dead haircuts
The bad thing was the first guy had no much hair to see the changes but the second that had a little bit much hair had absolutely no changes
the 35 pesos..
70 peso was better
are you guys are AMERICAN. .?
Did the second guy even get a haircut
"our country is not perfect but you guys look make Philippine  great, thank you"
35 pesos okey. 250 pesos is a waste of money.
i woundt call either of the cuts a haircut more like a touch up
"OMG, he‚Äôs cuterüò±"
I always prefer p35 now its p50 but still with a tip. I prefer the old school way of haircut than the salon gay method which is only good for women.
I get my haircut for 50 pesos here in cavite bacoor
In India at least I&#39;ve had a haircut for minimum 30 Rupees = 0.46 Dollar.
Does anyone tip for haircut in Philippines?
They&#39;re both excellent.
I&#39;ll go for $ 0.70
"If I need a haircut after just receiving my salary I&#39;d go to the more expensive one, any day a week after I got my salary then I&#39;d go with the cheaper one."
"both of you look the same, dead trims"
1st one was better
Maybe I should travel to Indonesia next time for a 0.70 cents haircut. I wasted $20 u.s. yesterday and my hair was butchered. I usually have to go get at least 3 haircuts to where I can feel remotely satisfied with my hair. I&#39;ve noticed that people in eastern countries cut better hair because they take the time to cut your hair with detail and cut your hair the way you want it and not the way they want it or think it should be like most if not all stylists/barbers/etc behave here in America. Cool video of the experience though.
probably late comment but try on the original barbershop where oldies were working. They can do that better plus a free back and head massage with a price 35php too
"Haircut is better the one with 35 peso,"
"Please do take note that not all P35 haircut in PH is as good as what you have experienced. Several are worse especially if you are in Manila. Filipino barbers with cheap price are self taught. On the other hand, the main reason why some barbershops have higher prices is because of a marketing strategy. They may have trained barbers but it does not mean they are excellent at it. Cutting one&#39;s hair is also a form of art and cleanliness."
Julian&#39;s haircut is betterüòèüòèüòèüòè
Wow nice hairüíñ 70 cents is the best
60 pesos haircut worth it :))
.70 cent is the best....huh...
Kuya Will is doing it !!!
I was getting a haircut for 20 pesos ... sucks my hair is not growing fast enough ..hahahahahaha
Still bother cheaper then what I pay which is 15$
Filipino barbers are very good and they do it with extra massage
If something is shown in slomo it is PREMIUM
Go to Bruno‚Äôs it‚Äôs nice I got my haircut there for 300pesos
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YWOumqrr7U&amp;t=2m51s"">2:51</a> i know this is off topic but that EXO mask tho"
35 pesos haircut looks a lot cleaner but it also depends on what type of haircut you asked for as opposed to your friend. It seems like you asked for a natural look.
i love a great bargain so i&#39;ll go for the 35 peso which came out awesome.
thats in the surigao city??
It&#39;s crazy how a fancy place Is still only $5
Bakit may tatak ng rusi ung razor xD
35 pesos for sure
are you guys french?
Tu parles francais ??? Parce que t as un accent francais... sinon tres bonne video üëå
Barbers/stylists charge charge $35 CAD and aren&#39;t doing a job as clean as those guys.
In Finland basic haircut costs about 35USD :D
Its now 50php or 1USD due to taxes üòÑ

5 dollar hair cut is so cheap
Man he should go paid more than 70 cents for that damn
Both are cheap as fuck i pay fucking 50$ for mine
That guy who had 35 pesos haircut looks like Akshay Khanna.
Definitely the 70cent one. It was actually really nice. The 5bucks one was just all show.
Best way to check. Get a skin tight fade. Go back and redo it.
I pay 26 for a haircut here in California and that&#39;s without a tip
Did you get happy ending with that message.
Everyone is talking about the haircut but All i can think about is how the first hairdresser is a fan of exo( Kpop) YESSS !!!!!!!
First one seemed better
Parler en fran√ßais sa peut √™tre bien
Hahaha the last barber im the who train  him before he start being a barber Lol
Bading ba yun sumulpot sa huli?
7x expensive is for the workplace rent
The cheaper one was better.
ilike the haircut of 35 pesos
"Even though I can afford both, I‚Äôd much rather go with the 35 one. They practically look the same and I‚Äôd use the rest of 215 for food"
Both good haircuts and cheaper than what we pay here in the UK
filipino barbers can do haircut very good just using one clipper unlike in other country.
Kyah well in the background haha
"on the 0.70 USD haircut, you missed the &quot;barber talk&quot; (we call it &quot;kwentong barbero&quot;) part due to language barrier, in which you get to have a good chitchat about the barber&#39;s life expiriences and he&#39;d love to listen to your story too. in that way, the barber assesses wether you are a student; because student have discount. but in general they do it to provide good rapport to the customers so you&#39;ll come back to the same barber for sure! barbers in the Philippines are very friendly!"
35 Pesos is way better
More like jujus haircut
But I choose the local one the 35 php only because I trust them and known the barbers since I was a kid
You should try the barbershop Fix by bench because there good at it its also 250 php
Your doesn‚Äôt need a haircut lol
The cheap was real crisp and nice
Their worth it. I now live in US and the cheapest haircut I can get is 13$ and they suck ass. So when I go back home and have a haircut on a real barber shop like those 35P ones. I give them 5$ as a tip.
"who was that scary woman, where was she from bros? Is she a filipina or whatever?"
Definitely the 70c!
Hi can u sub me and i will sub u. Thanks
I like the 70cents dollar its impressive
35 pesos is the best.
"35 bucks haircut is so 2002, cheapest i heard as of now is 45-50... you can get 35 here but it would be in a shack or under a tree lol"
I  vote  the 1st  one! 35 pesos
$0.75 looks better
35 pesos is the best than 250 pesos
Hahahaha wowowin....lol
"They both great, definitely beats the $15-$20 here in U.S , lol"
.70 cent is the best . very clean
The $0.70 cent is much better !
250pesos haircut is hardly noticeable.
35 is the best very cheap.
Dont forget to give a small amount of tip when you get a good massage after the cut cheers mate üòÅ
"Im a filipino so i can tell what the difference, i think they are same but in different technique, the only difference i think are the equipment they used and the place,..thats why how cheap here in the philippines, thumbs up on the 1st barber man, he&#39;s so good.."
"very nice video, i have new video can visit us, thanks!"
I like the 35 pesos cut
35PHP is better..i go to Brunos Barber at SEASIDE and didn&#39;t get a massage after the haircut and i paid a total of almost 500PHP including the use of shampoo which in other salon shampoo is free after the haircut for washing remaining hair..
I bought hair trimming and i cut my hair so more cheaper than 35 pesos hahahaha
35 much better
Jojo&#39;s üëç
<b>and a sexy lady</b>
Joju looks hondsome with that very neat hairdo. The difference is the ambiance .
Please where is the exact location that shop?
"both haircuts are great..:) but i prefer 35 pesos haircut , great looks and great for the pocket. savings wise :)"
Jojo best one.üëç
omg the filipino barber is the best in the world. very very good looks humane. the best part is the 25 pesos is the better. is depends on the barber skills.üòÅüëçüèª‚úåÔ∏è
35 pesos
35
"I live in the Philippines and I had very bad experiences when getting in a saloon like I only went twice in a saloon during my college days thinking it was better than the local street barber shop. after that second trip to the saloon I swore I will never go back inside a saloon forever (that was 30 years ago).  To me the hairstylist don&#39;t look for the cut that will look good on me but instead try some trendy and latest haircut that look like disaster on me instead.  And saloons are so expensive so since then I only go to barbershops where I will just flop on the seat and just say &quot;make it short or cut the curls only&quot; the barber nods and I don&#39;t have any regrets.  Now I only tag along to saloons where my wife gets her hair styled.  When ever the stylist say if I&#39;d like my hair cut, I always shake my head."
.70 cent is the best one
35pesos better cut
I prefer the 35 pesos cut. I really miss going to the local barber shop and of course the neck and head so good.
"I would say 35 piso hair cut won because its cleaner however it only depend on how or what style you want as those hair stylist are experience. When it come to the price, mall rent is way cheaper than just the roadside  plus..the saloons name or brand..anyway this hair stylist sometimes rely on your tips..lol"
The .70 was the better haircut
lowest price wins.
Is this at Surigao City?
Qu est ce tu t embetes a donner les prix en dollars t es Europeen lol et n hesites pas a leurs expliquer que t es pas americain quand ils te disent &#39;hey Joe&#39; c est super pratique pour engager la concersation... bonne visite dans ce merveilleux pays qu est les Philippines Pierre
"You have to pay more at the mall because their rent is higher. The price has nothing to do with quality. If I have to choose, I would choose whatever is more convenient to get it cut."
its the same . . .ill go for 35php . . .
Most definitely the cheaper one is better however for the second one I guess he mostly paid to get a  hand massage really
"I believe it depends of the location, if the Barber shop is 3rd class, they don‚Äôt pay high rent for the shop, then it could be cheaper, the other one you had head and hand massage, better service higher price, only my opinion, but you guys are good looking, any type of haircut will look good on you, thanks again for the video, we enjoyed it."
It the depends on the Barber not scenery
Almost the same the diffence is only the equipments and the shop itself.....pretty good.... like it
"I like the haircut of JUJU?, the first one. It&#39;s neat and looks great on him plus it&#39;s cheaper. Hope you guys enjoyed your stay here in the PH."
I Like 35
"You forget to leave tip. Where is that Barber Shop located that is Php. 35 only? I will get my haircut over there. For me, both haircuts did well. But I like the cheaper one cause it cost less but the same quality."
Both nice i think
35.00 pesos wowww very cheap üòçüòä I got shorts hair I pay $AUD 25.00  here in Australia üòÇüòÇüòÇ ... anyway thanks to ur video more power to u üëçüá¶üá∫
"Cheapest will be in Pureza,  Manila. 20 php or around 0.4 USD."
Wow nice hair cut‚ùó u both look more cool after the hair cut for as cheap as 35pesos.
Its so cheap here in the philipines and if you want a haircut you can see it every where and then if youre done your hair looks cool!!!
no matter what haircut i have...im still ugly...think its not in the haircut...hahahaha
both is niceüòäbut the winner is the 35 pesos haircut üòäüòäüòä
better the 35 its almost the same cut you only pay for the place
Speak tagalog :)
"35 pesos is pretty cheap, here in our place the minimum cost of a haircut is 50 pesos."
"The P35 looks better tbh. The barbers in the cheap corner barber shops in the Philippines are usually quite skilled and will tell you interesting stories. In Filipino, we call it &quot;Kwentong Barbero&quot; :-)"
honestly its no difference at all..clean and good hair cut. handsone good looking guyz..<br>the only difference is the price.
Singapore haircut is so bad
I prefer the 35 dude..250 is too much
Ang mahal ng 250 ha.
"I wouldn&#39;t mind paying 5$ for a cut. A 0.70$ cut is just too good to be fucking true in my country. 5$ cuts are fucking good. Normally, you pay 20-30$ here and which is a lot more times expensive."
If you have too much drama in your hair..Prepare your 250 pesos if you what to have clean hair and dont care about the result take 35..Also if you mind give tips to 35 pesos base on your satisfaction..5 pesos tips might be too small but that that may level up you and the barber that can be trusted..
35 pesos ^^
i go for the .70 cents
I choose 35 pesos so cheaper.. But you  bot handsome...
I choose 35pesos...
35 pesos haircut rocks . 250 haircut you had is horrible the hairdresser is not doing anything at all. I am Cebuano but I will never spend 250 for haircut because there are more cheap salon I could find and the quality of work is the  same or better.
35peso won same result yet cheaper..
35p barber did a great ass job my barber dont even do a great job like him
"35 pesos with massage, thats great<br>I could hace given the guy extra dollar for tip"
i think 35 pesos is the better one
was in cebu for a month and had my haircut here 3 times @Brunos since it was so cheap compared to here in Canada...
35 clean cutüëçüëçüëç 250 u pretty much paid for the comfortable place. But gwapo parin guys without having the haircut doneüòçüëçüëçüëç
I&#39;ll go for ‚Ç±35
great point ..... thanks for sharing ur adventures !!!
"Fellow american here, I feel like the 35 pesos haircut was amazing and even with a massage"
hahah the hair cut! &quot;:D awesome!! glad ur happy ^^
"I think the P250 haircut is better but I never pay that,I go to the barber &amp; pay P60."
i prefer julian‚Äôs haircut. the cut is nicer and value for money.
Juju... looks cute üòÑ
"Wait, who asked who will be on the 35 pesos hair dresser?"
"The difference is the ameneties!!&quot;,,, and the place of hair cutting&quot;,, Juju has a 3 star hair salon while you&quot;,, is a 5 star salon&quot;,, ha! Ha,! Ha!&quot;,,"
Try the 15pesos haircut next timeüòäüòäüòä
actually the price really don&#39;t matter . what matters is the quality of the haircut if it reached your quality standards
"If i pay 250 pesos, I&#39;d rather choose to cut my hair in bald. Its worth my 250 pesos haha"
I guess the 35 pesos is the best..
a choose 35 pesos its better than 250 pesos hair cut
Julian looked like a doctor! Luv it! Definitely the .70c haircut Owned!
"hey if the barber says its P35 (O.70 USD) and your happy with the outcome, it will not hurt if you&#39;ll pay him extra like P50-P70 (1-1.50 USD). I pays my very efficient baber P60-80 even if he says its only P40. hello."
35 Pesos haircut (Juju&#39;s) for the win!
Both cuts are good..Filipino barbers are really good. The only difference is the location of both Barber shops hence the price difference.
The 35pesos haircut looks better. Id rather go to those because the barbers are far more experienced because of the volume of costumers they had everyday.
"When your having hair cut in a commercial area, it is more pricey than those barbershops along the streets. Bruno‚Äôs is one of well known barbershops around Philippines. It‚Äôs like a brand already. The PhP250 haircut should include shampoo too. Some new breed of barbershops offers free coffee or tea."
Same. Only difference is waiting time for the cheaper haircut
35pesos better
".70 cents is the best one, very clean.... the guy is very skilled with a great eye for details that suits you. there are people that can&#39;t follow instructions and you ended up regretting having a haircut and what you paid for... speaking from personal experienced."
In my place haircuts only 20 pesos and the barbers work is good..
wlng nbago kay pierrre Hhaha
wlng nbago kay pieree Hhaha
wlng nbago kay pieree Hhaha
wlng nbago kay pieree Hhaha
wlng nbago kay pieree Hhaha
wlng nbago lay pier
the 35 php worth...it&#39;s cheaper...
35 better
well to really test this out you should probably need the same hairstyle.
Hahaha pang girl ksi yun 200 pesos hahaha
"Nothing difference except the place and the amount they charge, you know what mine is. I&#39;m the new subscriber to follow because interesting and the small guy could be your brother or friend tell me pls!"
"Both of you have a really good haircut, but the expensive one,  it‚Äôs because you have a massage which is worth of your money."
"For a short haircut the less expensive ones will do. But if you want a haircut that&#39;s not too short but stylish, the expensive ones are better at dealing with those."
Thumbs up for the .70!!
You should give a shout out to both salons for their participation and their addresses for future business!
JUJU ^_^
70 cents looked better
I will go for Php35
Are you still vlogging here in Surigao City sir?  Hehehe

here in our place its 50 pesos.. $1 equivalent..
it&#39;s all about comfort and experience. i get my haircut at Bruno&#39;s because again I&#39;m going for the experience.
I&#39;d rather choose 250..its worth it... The have a style
There&#39;s a really big difference...
"Practically,  both haircut and both barbers are good.. so the price makes the difference and I will go to the cheaper one. Make sense?"
Hey visit iligan city.  maria cristina falls.  Google it..
kakamiss 35 peso haircut dito ¬£12 nearly P1000 haircutü§§
In the Philippines i&#39;ve never paid morethan 40 pesos for a haircut..the cheaper the better the only difference are the expensive one has air conditioned salon but the quality of the haircut are the same...
Ok nag ponta yan sila sa hair kafe salon namin sa kasaman palad wala kaming barber non hindi pomasok ang mga komag hair kafe ormoc city
The P35 haircut is a bomb!  The barber is really good.
"even if u guys got bad hair cut, still be handsome..."
bro you must visit  batangas and tagaytay  you must  try the lomi of lipa batangas ! it&#39;s  chinese thick  noodles that chinese brought  here in the PH and bulalo of tagaytay and go to starbucks there they have a nice view and cold weather
I like the $0.70 haircut better (although both look good!).
35 is better..:)
Nice hair cut both of you
The 35pesos haircut wins. Not even because it was cheaper.
hi new subs from philippines
Both are the same
PhP 35
"I go for 35 peso , very cheap üòÑ"
i love juju haircut
35 pesos is better...üòÄ
How about giving some tip
As a local resident in Philippines that see a barber every 20 days.  All i can say is that 35-50 peso barber shops have more amazing and skilled barbers than those of fancy salons.  And also you can have a good massage for free after the trimming session.
Filipinos are the b BEST BARBERS inn the world!!!
You should give them a TIP...!
THe first one is looking much better!
The 35 bucks wins!
qu&#39;ils sont beaux ces fran√ßais !!!!
35 pesos
"We still have 25 pesos express clean barbers cut, mostly student clients"
i agree that 7 times expensive does not mean 7 times better... i like the 35 pesos than the 250 pesos... you both good looking though...
Surigao City Barbershop won!
35 is best.. but it still  depends on how you told them the style you like .theyre just following what you like your to look like
It looks good on him. :)
why does the P35 pesos haircut looks better haha
Its better the first one
35 pesos is better
I guess the .70 cent will be the best one !
"The difference between the expensive and cheap haircut in the philippines is that the cheap ones are hit and miss, meaning you can ramdomly get someone amateur and could mess up your hair, but with the expensive ones, they are more trained and less likely the chance of messing up your hair...thats just my take as far as haircuts in the philippines."
Haha i ll definitly go back for a 35p üòâ
"it is expensive in the mall bec. they pay for the rent, clean,nice place &amp; aircon. that is what are you paying for."
Julian üòç
great vid. üëç
Juju ‚ù§Ô∏è
"You are paying the ambiance,the location,the instruments used  and the presentability of the barber that&#39;s the difference I supposed."
In Philippines Php 35 haircut + Free Massage. Don&#39;t see the massage??
the same nice hair cut the only difference is the shop itself haha
"in Philippines, 35 pesos is for on point haircut, 250 pesos - up for layering and trending fashion statement styles haha. great review. :)"
The 250 pesos is a safe cut. But the 0.70 cents is so amazing! The cut was so daring on doing so for such style.
The place and the rent make a difference plus the service other than that they&#39;ll just do the same haircut accordingly.
Kicked out!!! haha... jojo for me wins... lolz
Jun really good...nice one guys.thinks to feel cebu.god blees
Pinoys mostly go to barbershop down the street.
I agree with the pretty lady..
35 pesos win...barber shop is more experience than salon ...cheaper price much more customers
"250 not bad because that barber shop is renting the place,besides u mentioned it is in fancy mall..unlike the 35 peso they rent is cheaper or maybe  they own that placeüòä"
"its the same, the only point of view is that you are both handsome"
35 pesos win
Juju hair cut is more clean looking..
Agree with her..the 35 pesos is more cleaner look and good than the 200+.
‚Ç±35 is the winner! üëçüèº
35pesos haircut ^_^
NiceüòÑ
Wow!  Looks very nice!  I like it not because it‚Äôs cheap but because they did a great job!  The expensive one is good too but I think is super cheap too.  I get my haircut here in the US at least $25.00.
So handsome hihi
"Whenever I go for  a haircut in the Philippines, I give at least 200 pesos tip even at the low cost salons.  It is mind boggling how low people are paid, it depresses me."
"For haircut in the Philippines I go to both, they are different experience."
I go with the 35p
I&#39;ll go for 35 pesos
"Most Filipino barbers don&#39;t need to be told how to cut your hair. They know how to make you look good with your haircut. Whenever I decide to have a haircut (when I&#39;m thru with cropped hair) and don&#39;t know what to do, I often tell my barber to just give me a haircut tha suits me best. And I never get disappointed every time. I end up always giving them tips, mostly double their usual rate. Plus they even give extra service like massaging your back and head which really helps."
Very beautiful .
I will go for the 35pesos üòä
"I love the haircut of the first guy, very nice!"
"Nothing much change for 250pesos , 35pesos won! Yeheey üëç"
the rent inside the mall adds up to the cost of the haircut tho. lol
Both are equally done well it looks like. But i would go for the cheaper one since you can achieve the look you want for a fraction pf the price. Asians rock when it comes to haircuts &amp; hairstyles üëåüèªüòú
35 pesos best!!
"I guess it just depends on where you go but style wise, I like the first cut. It&#39;s cleaner."
35pesos all the way!! LOL
For me the 35 pesos haircut wins.His haircut looks really great.
Is there a extra charge for the neck and hand massage?
Only in the philippines. Cheap prize good quality! Thanks for loving our country üòò
35 pesos haircut won!
I will watch all ur ph vlog in friday. my day off i swear
Expensive when u go to. To a mall and getting haircut inside
This is why lots of filipinos are living in poverty.  With that skill and time spent I would be embarrassed to pay 1$.  I would have given the guy 10$ at least.
Nice a different this time :) üëç
"of course I would choose the 35 pesos haircut, that 250 peso haircut is too expensive.why pay more if you can also have a decent haircut for an affordable price. btw, both of you look good."
"Mostly, hair trim in metro Manila cost only P40 + a  bit of massage some parlors are really expensive because of the name but it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re way better, no. Well, of the two, I prefer the 1st one, it looks so clean and really nice."
"hey ur in my place at surigao.,hmm ur going to siargao right?haha"
"I always look forward to getting haircuts in the Philippines.   Every time I plan a trip home,  a haircut is always on my to do list.  You just can&#39;t get the same kind of service in the US for the price you pay.  The barbers in PI are more detailed.   They take their time.  And don&#39;t forget the xtras you also get, like a massage.   Thanks Pierre and Trina!"
"tried it before, it was 300php in a mall as well; and will not do it again. They just put added services like they will shower your hair, put some gel and be comfortable. :)"
I like better the P35.00 haircut.
No differeneces. Both are good. Great video.
Min 40 pesos in metro manila.
i never thought there still ‚Ç±35 haircut but worth it.
"Both did a great job. If I have to choose, I&#39;d go for the more practical option - the P35 haircut. But come on, cost of haircut here in the Philippines is much much less compared to Europe or USA. :D"
"35 pesos is way better and cleaner looking. though the 250 pesos is done in a nice barber shop, you&#39;re paying for the name of the shop."
gwapo na meaning handsome i prefer the 35 pesos haircut more precise cut and cleaner edges

Why are men having s** with children üò† absolutely disgusting
We cannot blame them. This is so sad for them. Blame the education and healthcare system
"If a man doesn&#39;t have a trade, certificate or professional degree and lacks the ability to comfortably support a family he shouldn&#39;t be rewarded with a child. Women should be at least 22, have a degree or a trade and be in a long term relationship with a productive man before having a child. Morality without economic opportunity is destined to fail in the modern world."

"As a filipino woman who was born and raised in the US, this makes me upset and disappointed in how my race treats it‚Äôs own people especially it‚Äôs own women .

"it is easier said that all life has a value but reality its extremely hard to support each mouth in the philippines, The govt and Religion would rather overpopulate the country in results more homeless folks/hunger and jobless than supporting contraception. The old ways is clearly not working so its time for change. For an island nation, it has probably x 3 of Canadas population which is the 2nd largest nation on earth. Differences between the two is that one is extremely controlled by the Church. Its one of the hard line facts that you all must be aware of."

How about the men impregnated these girls? What is the consequences?

"Get pregnant early, after promised of taking responsibility then live together, then having more kids?!!! Just why?"
This troubles me a lot. I had my period at 9 years old. I couldn&#39;t imagine having children at that age.
Use condoms and contraceptives. Why abortion! They need family planning education. The Vatican will be upset this is huw they make money in the Philippines making babies.
"All abrahamic religions are same. No Liberty, no respect for women . They are treated women as a birth machine"

Is this the future of our children if Republicans have their way?  Despite promise rings and Bible study there WILL be a huge upturn in very young mothers if ever strictrer abortion laws are enacted.  Restrict maternal health programs and food stamps and the resulting and inevitable children will will be born into desperation and dysfunction.  Require work for necessary aid recipients and now who is caring for the babies and children that come one after another.  Restrict birth control and never educate the young about human sexualityAI and automation fewer jobs will be available and those that are won&#39;t pay much.<br><br>This is a vision of the lives of women and children who live under archaic patriarchal rules.

Tell Marcos to bring back Abortion.
"When I was 16 I was with a 27 y/o man, many people would be shocked at that, I left him when I was 22 because he was nomadic and travelled for work and he wouldn&#39;t settle down. now at 53, many relationships later I&#39;m here to tell you its the best relationship I&#39;ve had, he always treated me well and provided for me.

Its sad how these babies will grow up and continue the cycle. Getting pregnant and becoming parents at young ages and dropping out of school. Truly disheartening the government doesn&#39;t help the situation much

"God  didn&#39;t say kill your child, even using pills is considered killing."
If you set an example of people around you like your neighborhood as a young girl would try your best not to het involved with boys or having a boyfriend at young age.I grew up in a slum area too but I was to afraid to get pregnant and be one of young mom. I never had a boyfriend untill<br>I married my husband at the age of 29. Young kids should listen to their parents i know parents talk about to distant with boys or having a boyfriend or else you wound up get pregnant I heard this words not just from my mom but also from neighbors telling thier kids that. I have a sister whose kinda like a black sheep never listen to our mom so she wound up having a baby at 15. I grew up not having enough food or missing school for a year or two cause of poverty that‚Äôs main reason I decided not to have a boyfriend if you‚Äôre not matured enough to handle a<br>Family.
And we blame all the teenage mothers for getting pregnant rather than make the ADULT MEN PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID. THEY ARE CHILDREN FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE.
This all so very sad. This video is 5yrs old so I do hope things have improved for these young women since this was originally posted.

Wow The Phillippines is so incredibly behind. They should be ashamed and embarrassed.
Seems like this country is cursed to live in poverty forever. They have natural disasters all the time and poor kids everywhere with no future.eee
How awful to never get to have a childhood üò¢ these girls are kids plain and simple
Parents would rather get their children pregnant than have an awkward conversation.
"God this is infuriating‚Ä¶ Wtf is this way of thinking?? It makes NO SENSE omfg üò≠üò≠üò≠ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ Wow, this is BEYOND misogynistic‚Ä¶ I hope these girls make it out of this somehow: they‚Äôre all victims of pedophiles, so sickening and heartbreaking. ü§Æüò¢üíî"
"in ph the legal age is 12? na, its 18, i am pretty certain."
This is utterly horrible and terrible. Lord have mercy on us please
This is horrifyingüòÆ
The best way to stop this problem growing is by culturally changing. It starts with parental tied control over their children.
"Gosh, get pregnant again and again! please birth control, children having children. These kids are destined to suffer, abuse. Please !"
üíÄ
Imagine how non human evil you have to be to ignore and not helping this things
I would feel bad for them. But like nobody tells them to created FilipinoCupid profiles lmao
"Age of consent, 12? <br>What?"
"Ya pues las organizaciones y la dichosa iglesia buena para nada, por que no costean programas par prevenir embarazos de adolescentes, pobres e ignorantes qu√© se llenan de hijos que vienen a sufrir necesidades porque ni lo necesario llegan a tener y siguen la Cadena de m√≠seria y hambre que nunca acaba, donde est√°n las narices de la iglesia y las organizaciones lps gobiernos NUNCA TIENEN PLATA NUNCA PERO SI HAY PLATA PARA REPARTIRSE ENTRE LOS PAR√ÅSITOS POL√çTICOS!! üò°"
"I am Catholic and grew up in the United States. I did use contraceptives to help plan my family, but would never consider an abortion as a way to plan my family. I am fortunate that I never had to make a decision in a case of rape, or a severe medical reason to terminate a pregnancy. I can tell that this video is from quite a while ago. I hope that some of this has been dealt with."
is there really nothing more sensible than giving birth early and many children
Rodel is 40 years old and Teril is 13! He needs to go to prison
I feel sorry for these young girls especially the 13 year old girl who lost her baby when she was 7 months pregnant she got pregnant by the 22 year old that has an addiction to sniffing glue he blamed her and she blamed herself for losing the baby. I didn‚Äôt know if she had a baby by the guy but she said she lived with him and his parents so she could eat. It‚Äôs so sad her father left and her mother couldn‚Äôt afford her so it sounds like she‚Äôs trapped living in the slums. Just sad
"its incredibly sad that the abortion rates are so high yet the goverment refuses to allow save abortions in hospitals, further increasing &quot;miscarriages&quot;."
"the fact that 12 is the age of consent while in other countries 12 is the age when you start learning about puberty in school is terrifying. 12 year olds are still children, they should be in school and playing with their friends not taking care of a child."
"Believe in Jesus Christ to be saved. Christ died for your sins and everyone&#39;s suffering. Believe that he died for you.‚ù§ Ephesians 2.8-9 &quot;For by grace are ye saved through faith. It is a gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast&quot; Christ died for these children and you too."
"A lot of these &quot;unplanned&quot; pregnancies sound like they are VERY planned:  by the men who impregnate the girls. And because they don&#39;t think they can do better in their lives, or because they are in love with these men, the girls go along with it. And then the men leave them. And even if they don&#39;t, they are destined to live in poverty forever, and each new child sinks them deeper into the poverty, so they never escape it. Very sad. <br><br>If these kids could magically, physically not get pregnant or impregnate anayone until they were 30, it might give them enough time to fix their lives and prepare for (maybe) one child. But they never give it a chance. They are too impatient, too in a hurry to &quot;grow up&quot;, wanting the privilege of a child but none of the responsibilities of bettering themselves to get ready for one."
I strongly support the Catholic Church&#39;s efforts in this country. I hope and pray that the Philippines government can eliminate illegal abortion.
"When I was 40yo, I&#39;ve already had a granddaughter. Here in the Philippines, poor or well off community teens gets pregnant in no time. With my case, good thing that my kid has decent life so they&#39;re learn to be an independent young parents, helping out the family business while in the university... I&#39;m 45 now with 2 grandkids, my older children are doing well in life despite of being a young parents like me."
"If parents of mother where legally responsible for a baby born to any daughter under 18 and father under 18 things would change. Father should pay support to woman, parents pay support for baby."
"In Canada, the best nurses we have are from Phillipines. These women are very smart.  Give them a chance and they will go far."
Shocking
In the USA its called rape...
Catholicism will wreck a society!
"I agree with Dr. Asuncion, education is the key to solve the problem. Nevertheless, it must be supported by the higher authorities, parents and the communities. And the Church too."
"The catholic church absolutely failed this country and still continues to do so.<br>They cherish life but do little to support these families and their children when they are born, like Christ commanded them to."
Prayers for Philippines; two of my godchildren have Filipino parents.  I‚Äôm Korean Canadian but look Filipina and have many friends in the community here
My daughter is 15 now. Still a child. I simply cannot imagine her having a baby at 12! This is a seriously shocking state of overpopulation and poverty in the Philippines.
All life is precious!
Sorry for the poor girls &amp; their family. At least the man must be responsible. <br><br>Kevin üáµüá¨
This is a tremendous problem in our country.
poor fetuses. these poor kids didn&#39;t deserve being killed like that
This was so sad to listen to. It must be so hard to live in poverty and be a teen and pregnant
"The show should get their facts straight , it&#39;s not only  a half a million abortions , it&#39;s a lot  more . ü§¨"
"90 % of the country is Catholic , that&#39;s why they don&#39;t use protection ! ü§¨"
"There are over 500,000 abortions there every year ! ü§¨"
So the  main problem is Fucktianity. No contraception. Ooops. Your god was born of rape too.
"*the problem in that country is pedophilia, the men who are sexually attracted to these young children. no matter what the legal age is in a country, everywhere in the world 10-13 is a very young child, so i can&#39;t understand how that even can be a legal age in a country. 13 year olds are everywhere CHILDREN. mix that bs age of consent with crazy poverty, and u get what you have in the philipines, lots of young gurls who fall victim to these men. very very sad because i know filipino people from there and they are some of the kindest, sweetest people."
"Robert here, married in the Philippines, 26, wife was 19, lied at first saying she was 29, found out, but still married her, our  beautiful daughter had to be watched going everywhere then I taught her martial arts, RAT SEAL fighting. Of course when they saw me around unlike boys who run away, this Dad loves his daughter to bring her here to San Diego, CA, when other kids are left behind. God bless these unwed mothers."
"My husband earns around $5000 a month, a pretty decent salary but we decided to raise just one kid. <br><br>Life is getting harder. Cost of living is getting more expensive. Its best not to get pregnant again. It will just ruin things for me and my husband esp to my daughter who is now experiencing the best things on life."
Why is the consent age 12?? 12 is still a child? What kind of ridiculous perverted legal system is that?
So sad
no  birth   controls ? ?
religious beliefs ? Ôºü
"My filipino friend told me.Their enviroment forced them to lived that way, what make it worst their government didn&#39;t do anything about it. and then sent their local woman to work abroad, became slave in foreign countries. bring half blood baby hoping them to became a celebrity on their homeland. This is gambling life they got in there. im so sorry for all the woman who lived that way in there."

Legal age 12 yrs is just like a forced Rape... Why Philippines govt is doing such crimes to it own country?
"They do not find anything wrot with, because they have normalised it, age of consent should be 18 ."
Many Philippine woman who get married in Japan  majority also are divorced .
&quot;I&#39;m proud to have such a beautiful wife&quot;... no you&#39;re proud to be a Pedo... don&#39;t try to make it sound better than it is... you&#39;re a disgusting pedo that preyed on a child....
Poor dog.. natrapped SA putikü•∫üòÖ
Now I understand why the evangelical missionary men like to go to the Philippines it&#39;s free reign for the pedophiles
come to africa to learn more
"If they‚Äôre gonna promote chastity and illegal abortion, at least make the age of consent 18 and up, 12 seems counterproductive"
The smile she has after all she&#39;s been through is scary.it&#39;s like she knows noone cares how she is so she  dissociated
It&#39;s sad that this happens because those babies will grow up in poverty continuing the cycle of suffering onto the next generation. If the family can&#39;t afford to feed the kids they&#39;ll just end up in the streets like in that 2015 Filipino movie Hamog.
Sad
"Thank you Catholic Church for always being against abortion. If it was not for your influence, it would have been legalized long ago."
American foreign aid also forbids birth control.  Let each female decide for themselves.  The catholic voodoo over uneducated people is a disgrace.
So she was raped &amp; her &quot;boyfriend&quot; taunts her?
Consent in the Philippines is 16 now.18 if you are more than 3 years older than the girl
What a terrible life they live
"I also wonder if the teenage pregnancy is such a dangerous predicament, has nature gone wrong with puberty age?"
I think age of consent should be reduced only when the society is educated and developed.
You make mass amounts of money if their was a White Baby Factory in this country far more other phillipines baby&#39;s.
This is why I like china child policy
"This hurts me deep inside to watch this, it truly hurts.  I cannot accept this as normal."
Uhm Weres the government this should be illegal this should be illegal for 20 or 30 year olds to date like 10 year old children
Expanding the population in a country of poverty means you are increasing poverty and suffering. <br>What a cruel game catholics play with people.
stupid white woman in their country trying to get cases filed against locals...very stupid to do that in a place where your life might be worth $50.

There is a very good meens of birth control with an asperin one asperin held between your knees daily will stop pregnancy!
Parents really need to start watching there little girls much better!
A 22 year old has no business with an 11 year old especially a paint sniffing fool that kid has ruined this little girls life!
Ignorance is the most dangerous weapon.
I am Also from the Philippines... I am grateful that my parents won&#39;t let me have crushes and let alone let me go play with other guys that I haven&#39;t introduced to them. As well if I didn&#39;t have a few friends that are girls. I am also grateful that I was provided with school and that my mom has made me hyper aware of my surroundings.

Filipinos are having children without thinking of responsibility. They view their children as their retirement plan.
"Passport Bros, here you go."
"Legal consent is 12 wtf wth bs it&#39;s actually supposed to be LEGALLY 21 because your old enough to smoke and drink and go to college and everything, 12 years to consent they are not even a teen yet or preteen or even able to understand or he fully grown yet to consent..... That government is corrupt and disgusting......<br>12 to 21 is rape....."
If you have real concern come to India.<br> Make a documentary about your Muslim friends being systematically herded like pigs and their women being forced into teenage pregnancies.
Yayy catholic church
Separate the women into part of the country where no men are allowed.
imagine you&#39;re just standing there happyily pregnant and a random camera man&#39;s taking a shot of you in their cameras stating &quot; a lot of unplanned pregnancies occur in the country&quot; lmao
Shame on you for supporting baby murder &amp; trying to paint it as empathetic.
This is what America will look like if the Republicans have their way.

"The age of consent is 12 YEARS OLD!!!!!!! This is insane.  This is rape, pure and simple.  Such a hideous religious system that makes her feel sinful for having a miscarriage."
Babies don‚Äôt matter.Who‚Äôs raising the kids do matter by the way.‚ù§
Yep- even the abortionish knows it is killing a real life- a human!
Adrenochrome for hollywood
No abortion in the Philippines. Just raise the age of consent to 18 and mote family planning.
The world is such a screwed up place.
"this documentary was made by Qatar, they are jealous of the philippines&#39; birthrate (2,53 perwoman ) while theirs is small (Qatar 1,85 per woman)"
so so sad
No one should be force to become a mother !!
What the guy said about overturning the women‚Äôs right about family planning was simply horrific
Unplanned pregnancy is a sin
All religions and all laws are Male Made.
I&#39;m not watching this . No 11 12 or 13 or 14 up until 17 at least should ever be pregnant and on top of that blamed for a miscarriage. I wish I didn&#39;t know that they can legally get a child pregnant ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Wtf?
So disgusting that men all over the world are allowed to behave in this manner with little to no discipline. LEAVE CHILDREN ALONE.
"I GOT PREGNAT AT 26 AND IT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY  lIFE<br>AND THE MOST PAINFULL.<br>I SWORD TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD NEVER, NEVER. NEVER EVER <br>GET PREGNANT  AGAIN!!<br>AND SO I DIDN&#39;T ,  <br>IM 64 NOW AND IT <br> WAS. BEST  DESION <br>I EVER MADE !!!"
Why are girl&#39;s bodies able to get pregnant when those pregnancies are so dangerous? How was this handled historically?
"&quot;they said contraception has side effects. They said it damaged the uterus&quot;. Um yeah, pregnancy is a pretty big side effect of not using contraception."

Show the girls what a healthy happy family looks like. The men and woman married out of own desire on both sides each person doing their role for raising the children in a happy and healthy environment. Giving the children and each other a sent of security of belonging to a pack.
tHIS GUY IN THE GOVERNMENT IS PATHETIC!
"In my observation about relationships outside the western world, girls instinctively choose older men for security first and love second. In Ukraine which is a country closer to western lifestyle and attitude, young girls prefer to marry older men than their age groups due to the same cycle of security and love."
Indonesia would be as bad as the Philippines but Islam is more accepting of contraception.
Madagascar the same -- some girls do not even experience their first period.
I don‚Äôt care for any of these girls. Their problem
"I can&#39;t believe some of the comments. Victim blaming and claiming &quot;feminists&quot; are overreacting.<br>Y&#39;all are disgusting. Nakakabastos, mahiya naman kayo"

"very sad story, sometimes they leave them no choice because poverty ... it&#39;s just sadüòîüòî"
"I&#39;m a Filipina myself and it is true that most Filipina teenagers get pregnant at such a young age. I honestly get gr00med and met a lot of ped0philes when I was only 12, but I didn&#39;t let them get into me, because I knew that it is not right for men who are in a legal age should date a 12 year old like me."
Totally incomprehensible situation  it seems.  The poor young girls.  The stupid men.  The irresponsible church.
Age of consent in the Philippines is now 16 years old as of 2022.
"wether a pregnancy was planned or not, its always painful to have a misscariageno matter how old you are, a mother is a mother"
Yuck that age
Contraception  these girls need
Abortion is not the solution they should criminalize sleeping with children! This is so sad that young girls are getting raped ü•≤
They need forced abortions until they are able to earn decently
wtf
Some of these girls really like banging.
"It&#39;s not the people and teenagers that need educating. It&#39;s the country&#39;s leaders. When will they understand that the larger the population the greater the burden on the country&#39;s finances. When the number of people with no income outnumber those with an income and there is not enough land available to the poor to grow food and raise livestock to feed themselves then the theory of &quot;more people equals more Government Finances/Funding&quot; no longer is sufficient to meet the Country&#39;s needs. Too many impoverished people does not increase the Country&#39;s Income. Too much crowding without a sufficient Medical and Sanitation Infrastructures, because of lack of Government Action, puts the Country into an unsanitary and unhealthy state. But the Governments Leaders Make Sure They Are Paid And Paid Well. Their living areas have Sufficient Medical and Sanitation Infrastructures. The Country&#39;s Leaders are the ones that NEED EDUCATING. Why can&#39;t they provide the Medical and Sanitation Infrastructures needed for the POOR? They might see the light IF THEY WERE LIVING where there was insufficient Sanitary Infrastructure and Insufficient Medical Resources."

Its all wrong, my mom literally prepared all things this home feel so much better, warm with the coffee scent, big tidy bear seems cool , im save now, im educated, her love will never end and will stay by my side untill the end. I feel all love that my parents have given right after i watch this, they really look after me, they know a lot how to get me save eventhough they are not here because my childhood was filled with glory days and no one forced me to do such an adult stuff."
The catholic church needs to feed these children since they have blocked contraception.
ü§¶
the phillipines needs dictator a one party state.
Birthcontrol and education! Enough slaves and poor without food
a religious man in charge is never good news. have a woman rule this country and maybe something will change for the better.
T A X. T H E. C H U R C H E S.
i can comment right now i only saw the tittle Abortion is murder it doesnt matter what doctors or scientist call it
"the Catholic church has a lot to answer for ,let alone, the Draconian non / no divorce laws lucky if the woman can get an annulment from abusive unions, at extortionate prices ,an the abuser still has to be compensated for losing his wife ,Women are  &quot;chattels&quot; treated like farm animals under the Law"
"Organized religion is the worst drug humanity has.,,,,"
"if parents don&#39;t stand up for their children, then who would."
Religion is the guilty party here.  Keep young people ignorant so they will follow their abusive ways.  Keep them poor and stupid that is how you control the people.
"I think this is for different parts of the country cause where i come from in pangasinan, it is shamed if you get pregnant as young as 19"
There so many teen pregnant.  In England and USA.  Why only talk about poor countries.
the solution lies in raising the age of consent to 18
"My mom.was treated badly and called an old maid when she was 16 and not married yet. And that&#39;s the America in the 50s. From the beginning of time girls have been married and became mothers. And we really should impose our standards on other societies, peoples and cultures. How are you going to charge a man when that&#39;s the ways its always been in their society? Educate on contraception, work on the politics. Don&#39;t try to mess up a girl who is probably eating better, and taken better care of. I&#39;ve been hungry. I totally understood how simple and important that reason was for her, because they feed her good."
So this system basically puts very young girls under the care of their rapists so that the rapist doesn&#39;t have to go to prison? This makes my blood boil.
"Abstinence won‚Äôt work as you can. But contraception on the other hand is needed here the kids suffering. If they gonna allow this they need to pay for housing, food and medical for these young mothers."
Education education education on life!!!!!! Is needed.
These girls are being raped.
Allow samesex marriage . But not the abortion‚Ä¶!!! Don‚Äôt let people to be a killer‚Ä¶üò°
"The age of consent here in The Philippines has just been raised to 16.  Little by little, there&#39;s some progress."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=1m45s"">1:45</a> shes not even seductive. she&#39;s tiny. speaks like a child. p-do ph-les like to blame not knowing that a child was a certain age because of their appearance but there&#39;s no excuse here and this toilet bowl country seems to make a culture out of every taboo thinkable. honestly it&#39;s worse than slums of africa and brazil. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=5m43s"">5:43</a> see? he &quot;claims he didn&#39;t know her age.&quot; you&#39;d think dating someone would require knowing at least the basic information on their ID cards like name, birthday, and address."
The US Supreme Court is cool with this.
The idea that they think abstinence is the answer is ridiculous. Grown adults can not control their self (as proven by this documentary) so how do they expect KIDS to control themselves.
"This documentary makes my blood boil. ALL of these girls said they didn&#39;t want to, they were forced or just finally gave in. That is the definition of RAPE"
"All I see in this video is rapists, abused children and innocent babies whose fate is to continue the poverty cycle"
"Wtf 10? Shuta hindi yan teenager bata yan, grabe:&lt;"
"These people think it is acceptable to raise their son a to be users, abusers, exploiters, etc. they put their sons primitive desires over everyone else‚Äôs well-being. Your sons have no business behaving this way. As long as you allow your sons to be monsters you will all suffer. They are free to raise their sons better. They don‚Äôt want to. They don‚Äôt want to discipline their sons."
And many western old men go there preying on these underprivileged girls.. some one need to stop this also.
BUT ABSTINENCE IS NOT ENOUGH! THAT&#39;S WHAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NEEDS TO KNOW! IF NOT CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS WILL KEEP REPEATING THE CYCLE AND KEEP GIVING BIRTH!
"No men ever treasure or appreciate your virginity. Men are selfish, just wanting their needs to be satisfied,after that they leave just like that without even saying goodbye"
I am speechless
Very sad. Makes me sick.  Seems that parents don&#39;t care either
I want to jump through the TV and strangle these ‚Äúmen ‚Äú . Those poor girls. üò¢
"i am from philippines 28 years old and not yet married and no kids yet<br> but there still pressure from other people asking &quot;why no kids yet,why not get married you are old enough&quot; <br> me: who cares im busy working to save money for my future kids .<br>its like they mocking you <br>its like a culture to get married and have kids at early age in our province"
A 12 yr old is a baby
And the philippine government does nothing to curve this?
"Age of consent 12?  That‚Äôs crazy.  They should require at least 16 and if they aren‚Äôt legally married, the baby goes for adoption.  If the Church is going to call the shots regarding birth control and abortion, then it needs to require the other Catholic standards, like marriage, no adultery or fornication, taking care of your children.  Education is badly needed well before puberty!"
I felt sick while watching this.
"some men are just disgusting, guys...."
This governor is funny his like.. Life is life!!!  I bet he doesn&#39;t even help this kids feed kids..
I&#39;m a Filipino and I feel sad for this. I hope this problem will gonna have an effective solution.
She is a child and that monster of a boyfriend should be castrated.
"That&#39;s what they are going to try to do in America. Lower the age of consent to 12.<br>So, what is the solution to the problem? Is this why the Demodemons are pushing for America to fund abortions all over the world. Maybe, they should just casterate all the men instead."
No family planning!
But Catholics don&#39;t help to raise the child. Priest don&#39;t know how difficult it is because they are just in church just waiting for money
Why is teen pregnancy is on the rise in Super religious countries
I have only seen this area on this vlog. This is not a true picture of the whole country. This is slum area. I have not been into these kind of places in my own country. I visited many beautiful places and not witnessed ugly situation such as this.
"He cannot be charge if the girl will say she is willing and it&#39;s concensual. The age here is 16 for consensual relationship, it use to be 12 yrs old. My grandma married at the age of 14 because a long time ago it was okay. But it wasn&#39;t like just marriage it is actually for her own good and to remove her from suitors and to stop everyone from bothering them. Her father was so afraid that she will marry filipino man. She was very pretty, a mix chinese spanish girl and everyone was obsessing about her. Her father doesn&#39;t like her to end up with a poor man. So he talk her out of it and told her it&#39;s for her best to be married to one of her fathers friend. He&#39;s father said never marry poor men they are going to make you suffer and will treat you like a slave. So she agreed to marry my grandpa. All suitors were angry at them and started throwing stones at their house. Men used to serenade her, her father tells her they are useless and trash and cannot be her husband she will destory her life incase. My grandma told me she agreed because she knows it&#39;s for her best, poor men are not good to be a husband. She also needs to marry her own kind not others. she never regret it anyway, she always told me always choose the decent wealthy ones, should be DECENT since it is going to be a family. Rich is not enough, it should be decent respectable people. You don&#39;t want to be under the lowest situation in life specially if you are female. Female should be taken cared by the husband. When she was still alive she told me if I cannot find a good man never get married for the sake of being married just stay single and don&#39;t bring embarassment to our family."
"Pedophiles and child brides, it&#39;s disgusting... Poor kids born to such parents."
10 years old? Can you imagine  having a 30 year old getting with your 10 year old daughter?
"Abortion would never be the answer to growing population. Discipline en strict implementation would somehow lessened the growing of population. God made the world big so it would populated by people. According to scientific explanation, population is not the problem but the rules made by greedy people that&#39;s why there are homeless or unemployed people."
Looks to me like sexual assault is rampant in the Philippines.
"as a filipino that happens only in manila though , in cebu cases like that isn&#39;t that normalized"
"Young pregnancy is not only happen in Philippines its happens all over the world,"

This is why I act autistic in public/j :trollface:
"In the west and even in the more developed parts these problems exist,I think abortions are more acceptable and advertised as an option......the right discussions need to be have on roles and family planning throughout the world.not thinking of family planning as abortions but serious thought and discussions which would lead to a population wide sensitization."
"The children are soo cute, it really breaks my heart to see how they live! üíî"
hmm legal abortion should be implemented set the religion aside
I recommend you to go to Arabian countries and spread the contraceptions there‚Ä¶

"Abstinence is the only way? They‚Äôre idiots, 12 is the age of consent. Contraceptives is the only way to go"
I need to go to the Philippines. Sounds like a fun place.
If you live in the US you had a 4% chance of being born here. Be grateful of the privileges you have that others do not. Maybe now you‚Äôll into your own life and realize that many problems you have aren‚Äôt that big of a deal(first world problems ig).
"It boils my blood on how abortion is illegal in our country. &quot;on any under circumstances, even rape&quot; Seriously? Why are the higher ups so arrogant, the more teenagers get pregnant, the more the country is living in poverty. Young girls are getting groomed, being forced to Sexual intercourse, and even had to end their dreams. This should be changed."
They are beautiful people so sad the girls not the old azz men

"Whose to be blamed here, but those countries that do not want the Philippine to become prosperous."
"In my country we are taught about the body and how babies are made in our last year of primary school. Then our first 2 years of high school are spent hearing about pregnancy,  stds, laws surrounding children and teenagers in sexual scenarios, parental planning , contraception etcc..<br>I always thought our schools were doing too much because we have the Internet and can search for everything ourselves but I now understand that I was wrong ."
Just saying but the first girl looks staggeringly similar to a certain Filipino star Kathryn Bernardo.
Poor Angela.she looks tired . I hope she gets a good night&#39;s rest and some help.
The ignorance is amazing. ü§î
"The equation is identical in all third world üåé:  deep ignorance bolstered by deep religious dogmas, <br>corrupt governments, had been going on for centuries, like in an unstoppable cicle."
It happen Mostly in Slum.. And blame the Catholic church üòÇ
"These older men are predators , and thier &quot;girlfriends&quot; and &quot;wives&quot; are victims"
The Catholic Church has so much to answer for.    One of the most evil organisations on earth.
"Just make tougher laws, my gosh 12 as age of consent, what is UN and WHO doing, sleeping I guess, illuminati games"
"Look closely, this is what the Theocratic States of America will look like if the Republican party is successful.<br>(they will be successful)"
Newly dating a Filipina and came here to learn more about her culture. I don‚Äôt think YouTube was such a great idea üòÖ
Angela looks so tired and in pain‚Ä¶it really hurts my heart to look at her and not have any way to help her ‚òπÔ∏è
"i feel so fckimg bad for thay girl, she is so beautiful and obviously deserves so much more. Having to sleep with a guy to survive is so horrible and blaming themselves for the miscarriages says a lot. that buy has to be arrested."
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN SOCIETAL RAPE OF WOMEN. I do not think education will help in anyway unless your educating men on how to control themselves and furthermore penalizing rape. How a 28 year old man can sleep with an 11 year old girl and feel this is ok (which we see they are fearful of legal repercussions so there is some level of awareness that these societal practices are frowned upon) is beyond me.
As a filipino girl i didn&#39;t know the age of consent was 12 i thought it was 18 like bruh my sister became an adult at age 18 wdym its 12? Maybe because i live somewhere way less... like this... i grew up in a good community.
"Sounds like issue is poverty and pedophilia, not the fact that they cant easily and legally murder their unborn."
So this video is about :<br>1. Catholic Religion vs. Abortion and Contraceptives<br>2. Age of Consent<br>3. Men who should be in jail
t his is so disgusting  only the poor babies suffer   shame on the local governments   and education  kids also know right from wrong
"This is true, parents would rather have them live in together than have their daughter branded as &#39;disgrasiyada&#39; disgraced. For it also hurts their social image in their area and would choose to save that than their child and grandchild."
Abortion is considered more sinful then r@ping children apparently.
I feel bad for her and the fact she&#39;s not the only one?
"This is the unfortunate difference between upper class and lower class, while the upper classes knowing more than the less educated  lower classes resulting the poor having a lot of children at a young age than the rich"
This is the future of the US and it‚Äôs sad.. the war on women is going on all over the world and it‚Äôs awful
It&#39;s seriously annoying how abortion is still not allowed in the Philippines. (Legally)
Brakes my heart
This is because all of these people in the manosphere going to the Philippines game not paying any kind of child support
They always want to make it a pregnancy and baby problem but in reality its a sexual assault problem and predator
So contraception is the answer then is it!?!?...what a foolish notion when thousands of young girls are raped on a continuous basis!!...so let‚Äôs keep the young girls from getting pregnant but not keep them from getting raped!!!...such a repugnant way of thinking!!...they need education and better laws more equipped to protect women...this is a very bias documentary!..the woman doctor was the only one who said anything that made sense..educate the children from an early age of how to conduct and respect themselves!!...it‚Äôs like the narrator only wants to keep kids from getting pregnant and not from partaking in risky sexual habits!
as a kid we called it Chinese skip.

"I don&#39;t blame these girls at all for wanting and doing abortions illegally. I don&#39;t like that they are doing it so late into the pregnancy which at some point become a real feeling, moving fetus and eventually baby. I think if they are so against abortions they should enforce vetter laws access to birth control and teaching about this stuff"
Just to think they had to do it so this poor child could become preganat disgusts me
The lord would never be mad at her for that. It‚Äôs only the men that put that in there head
So nasty bro
Age legal concent in the Phillipines 12? This report is wrong? It&#39;s 18  not 12 they should give a video erratum for this?
Legal age of consent is 12??? Are you sure about that? It&#39;s 18 and it&#39;s not 12. Wrong information!!!!!
this just makes me mad
Im sure that catholic guy has raped lots of women and girls and have lots og HIdden children. His whole being screamd pervert. His ignorant to all the suffering and problems not using contraceptives has caused or he doesnt care.

This county has so many problems with it. Without changes they will continue to never develop.
"I am soooooo depressed üòî after watching this ,they are. Catholic so can&#39;t do abortions but can do prostition üò°what kind of law is this"
They are just teenagers... They can be easily manipulated... I feel bad for them..
:(
These men testicles needs to be amputated. This is statutory rape. Big grown men should go and find women in their age group. Dirty dogs.
Dito Lang ako Para sa English subject namin eh
Age of legal consent is 12???? Yikes!
My heart jumps with watching this. So sad so many teenagers losing their lives this way
Someday. Someday if I become a successful person I&#39;ll use my voice to change atleast a small percentage of this horrible part of the world. F*ck! I think I can&#39;t do it  and it&#39;s breaking my heart to see such things continuously happening and I can&#39;t do anything at all.
I can&#39;t help but cringe. I wish laws becomes more strict despite the increase of the age of consent I still can see this problem very widespread in our nation.
Now even church broadly ingaged in presidential candidate idk if this is good or bad

Abortion is a ritual of devil worship since they kill the fetus. It is a blood offering from the willing party.

Over populations main problem of the Philippines
"problem is not anything about contraceptives...it&#39;s complex and deep and interrelated....poverty is one...women having low view of themselves is another...women being easilyu manipulated and seduced, promised deceptively to, women just being so gullible...women being gaslighted, women taught the wrong things in church or from elders...they were never taught to believe int hemselves, know their worth, that they don&#39;t need evil men, thatt here are evil men out there...that they deserve better kinds of men...that they dont have to feel guilty..that they SHOULD say no...thatt hey dont have to live in dire need of men coz men will tend to abuse them if they are so depserate and vulnerable......that their worth is not based on virginity neoither in their submission ord ependence on men..that they can say NO..that they should never give them an inch in their lives...thatt ehy should run away from such evil selfish immoral men who dont hav ea sense of love, sacrifice, responsibility, respect...yeah, respect."
"The answer to this problem isn&#39;t more laws, it&#39;s making men stand up to who they are supposed to be.  Committed protectors and fathers, instead of users and players.  The same church that pushes sanctity of life also needs to push the men of that faith to stand up and  be men, instead of boys who play around and don&#39;t assume responsibility."
"I used to be a devoted Christian, but thanks to these documentaries I was able to educate myself that I have been believing a wrong ideology that abortion is a sin. Churches in my locality even have monumental graves for aborted children. The church should have nothing to do in this kind of crisis. This is a call out to all teens, this delusional philosophy has to STOP ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è"

Pilipino chronic poverty is the product of Pilipino arrogance to reality perpetuated by indoctrination of Catholic church since Spanish era...Contranception is not promoted or against religious teachings...Another false beliefs....are children are blessings from God...the more children the more blessings...even not enough food or education...Buhay parin si padre Damaso...Ang hindi alam ng maraming Pilipino....Ang tinutukoy ni JP Rizal na Sisa ay ang mga Pilipino...Nabaliw sa mga pamana ng mga kastila...Ang halimbawa ng kabaliwan sa Noli me Tangere...Ay ang pag sasayaw sa Obando Bulacan....para pag takpan ang mga nabubuntis ng mga kastila o pari...Remember...Maria Clara...anak ni padre Damaso...

I dont think any westerner has any right to go into a poverty stricken area of Asia and put a video of it shaming the people. These people are just trying to survive.
Long time ago US government aided contraceptive pills and others contracetions methods but they stop it
To have a baby is a blessing a common attitude among pinoys. Those people  with mental issue are the one that aborting babies which is illegal here. Aborting baby intentionally is a crime here.
Taga pilipinas ako. Men should take the blame not women.<br>To all women who are reading this pls educate each one of us. Diploma first before others. Forget temptations
Omg it is so sad that the man wants a baby and the woman sopostly have to say yes without consent it
"Galina, was on another documentary i believe her boyfriend was very hateful to her. and blamed her for her miscarriage. this is terrible im glad shes doing good now and healing."
"what do you expect when you are poor. no other choices and options to enjoy life. this is one of the effects of poverty... no education, less opportunity, starvation, crimes, early pregnancy and so on..."
She&#39;s too young to know about contraceptives but not too young to be pregnant!???
"We should legalized safe abortion here in the Philippines for minors, victim of rape and incest. You felt sorry for an organ that you will abort but not worry that once they grew up, they will suffered the most because of your ignorance action. And what the girl said, &quot;Gusto nya na kong mabuntis kaya pinagbigyan ko naman sya&quot; ginagawa nyong joke ang pag gawa ng bata."
"Cat calling is sexual harassment , call the cops on those pervert men"
"As messed up as it sounds forced sterilization  would solve a lot of the worlds problems as well as getting. Of course religion plays a part, does nothing but harm"
Another example of how religion can be a curse on people. Education is the key &amp; in this case mis education. Stop believing blindly in Catholicism. Take practical lessons in life. Get a good education so you have a job. Always make sure a contraceptive is used. Do not have babies until you can afford to.  So much to learn. Take example from other countries where the baby problem doesn&#39;t exist!
Napaka dumi naman ang mga bahay  ang daming basura hindi naglilinis nakakahiya

"Here&#39;s the PROBLEM:  Hateful foreign feminists wish to IMPOSE THEIR OWN agenda upon the people of the Philippines.  If this is truly a &quot;problem&quot;, the Filipinos THEMSELVES should be the ONLY ones to solve it.  This piece is just dripping with ANTI-heterosexual male hate."

"You judge us the wrong way, shame on you. You got your facts not throughly found nor researched.fully well just to make a documentary like this . This is just a portion of the issue on abortion on only parts of the country decades ago. The country bans abortion, and like in any other country, the practice is covert or an underground process not blatantly practiced."
My sister got pregnant when she was 17 now she has 3 children she became an example for me and now I&#39;m studying hard to finish school and have a successful career
Im from philippines there are no baby factory..abortion illegal  in philippines thats why they will hide to do abortion...your news is not true..fabella is the public hospital thats why many pregnant woman they like to give birth in fabella..fabella is wellknown for birthing hospital

"Sorry but I don&#39;t give a fk how it sounds. The Catholic Church has far to much influence, &amp; is wrong in every way to preach that you should keep having as many children as &quot;God allows you&quot;. With birth control you can literally be pregnant almost every year. Not healthy for either mum or baby for one. But those priests &amp; who eva else is bible bashing out that they should continue to have as many kids as possible. While they watch the poverty that so many families live in due to so many children, &amp; the suffering of the parents, who are often, in the majority in a lot of places. uneducated. So they were probably born into a big family who, cos they had so many kids were not able to go to school so cycle keeps going. And having constant kids makes it so much harder. That&#39;s been evident for dk knows how long. But still they preach that it&#39;s screwed up."

How sad to hear that you do not use contraceptives because you are a catholic.
&quot;why did i commit such a sin that i played garter&quot;
I mean they should either make the age of consent higher or f*cking allow contraceptives/birth control. People are romanticizing teenage pregnancy and people are too blind to see the problem in that.
"This is false news, age of consent in Philippines is age 18 years old and above"
"1 Corinthians 7:36, KJV: &quot;But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.&quot;<br><br>1 Corinthians 7:38, KJV: &quot;So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.&quot;<br><br>Everything starts with a proper parental guidance in order to avoid teenage pregnancy."
Religion and government should always be separated. God knows what is better for the people and it&#39;s country. Mahal tayo ng ating Panginoon kaya dapat tayo ay manalig lang
The sad part is that they always blames the government even though the government had done so far to prevent these teenage pregnancies. :&lt;

"Now this is why we shouldn&#39;t normalize a baby is a &quot;blessing&quot; nowadays. As a teenager, I&#39;ve been more open with the problems regarding about teenage pregnancy and how it affects our population the next few years."
What happens if a girl get pregnant by raping. Do hospitals proceed operation ? The law allows it ?
"It‚Äôs ironic how the prolife people support the birth of children yet they don‚Äôt insure economic support to insure children have homes to live in; food to eat, medical care and education.  As a conservative, I agree that killing unborn children is bad; but watching children raised in extreme poverty is just as bad.   I have very few Christian friends who have even adopted a child or support mother/baby programs."
As a Filipino I feel ashamed to this kind of situation but I&#39;m thankful to God my hometown is not like this
Moral of the story: Never play chinese garter or you&#39;ll get pregnant
That&#39;s why love is blind you don&#39;t know what gonna happen in future. It&#39;s risky.

that was fake news! if you are lower than 18 the guy can go to jail but nobody wants to bother at the time to file complaint because  the previous administration doesnt care about the people!!!
I am so glad the government raised the legal age of consent to 16 now.
Not filipino&#39;s getting mad at abortion but really approved at death penalty lmao
16 is a more understandable consent age

im from the philippinese  and its true some men are abusive but mostly its the girlfriend and boyfriend choose to have a kid or sometimse its the parents decision.
This is makes me feel ill these men are so uneducated and disgusting.<br>As for the older women this has been going on for years and act dumb.<br>Why isnt the government stepping inüôÑ

Well I guess <b>&quot;Its more fun in the Philippines&quot;</b> if you ignore their darkside.
Just some of the rotten fruits of the Catholic church!!!! It actually encourages and promotes the worst treatment of women by men.
The reality is that countries that adopt strict patriarchal religions value and protect women LESS. The exact opposite of what they promise women.
The slums scene is so difficult to watch :(
It&#39;s funny living in a Christian country where age consent is only 12 years old but doesn&#39;t want to legalize abortion and divorce.

Go away Al Jazeera. Your ultra-left leaning anti-Christian agenda is disgusting and definitely not welcome in the Philippines.

"As a Filipino I can say that our government is worthless and corrupted. They did nothing but steal. In all the elections I have never heard a politician talk about these problems. If they want the philippines to prosper, maybe they need to control the population. Maybe the first thing they should do is solve the real problem of our country. Which is overpopulation that leads to poverty and crime."
I don&#39;t care about the religion and state laws what I care about is their education and the age of consent.

Family planning and contraception to young women and men.
This population explosion is what making the Philippines wallow in poverty.
Population eductation.
That is why th ePhilippines is exploding in population because these young men and women are not educated.
"The plight of these teen-age young mothers has to be improved, discourage teen-age pregnancyin the provimnces and in poor areas in Manila."
12 is the consent???!! WTF THATS DISGUSTING.
It is sad seeing how girls as young as 10 years old are being forced into sexual activities by their so called boyfriends who are more that half their age which is basically sexual assault or r*pe. These OLD MAN are manipulative and degrative as the girls fall pregnant just so the old man can accept them. The other sad part about it is that only girls are hold accountable for this because the statistics that we are being given are only about teenage pregnancy and dont include the OLD MAN who actually force this girls in sexual activities. This makes me feel sad and i just wish to finish school and make money to help people.
Many poor family have many children that they can&#39;t support them   the lease the govt should do is to teach them family planning and provide some social welfare
Philippines:*minority 17 below* <br>Also Philippines: 12 age of consent
12 YEARS OLD IS AGE OF CONSENT?!?! YOUVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME?!? DISGUSTING!!!!!!
"After watching this video, I lost faith  in my own race"
"I am living in  Southern part of India. Here for me there is not much problem . School doesn&#39;t like students dating if they finds someone one doing then they will report them to their parents. If a boy and girl talks to each other or walk with each other society thinks they are in love. Yes in India child marriage is there but pregnancy before marriage is low because getting pregnant before marriage is considered as a sin . I am a Christian we are taught that abortion is a sin same goes for getting pregnant before marriage. Poverty and lack of education is the main reason for early pregnancy and marriage in every parts of the world. I won&#39;t say I am safe here. But I am much safer than those girls because of my family, friends, teachers,government , society and culture"
I realised that I should be thankful for my parents and that I must study hard for myself. It&#39;s just sad knowing there are some who were privileged and unfortunate and the government has nothing to do.
Baby factory ü§¨ü§¨
good on you filipines. god protect every baby that is conceieved. they need to be protected even at the point of conceivement. would you........... kill someone who is alive?
Pity illiterate people must be made leterate
"It&#39;s not the Catholic church to be blamed,, but the parents themselves... Our Government created family planning agencies but the poor locals didn&#39;t pay any attention for that... And they usually say &quot;mas masarap Ang bawal&quot; meaning &quot;more mistakes/forbidden more delicious&quot; just describe about it in your own language..."
"Godness JUDGEMENTAL PEOPLE LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY ITS LEGAL ON (ONLY IN SOME OF PALAWAN TRIBE) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=4m03s"">4:03</a> They have there own government i guess and they have rules on their own tribes that men&#39;s can married many woman as long as they can feed them but in the LAW OF NATIONAL PHILIPPINES (ITS ILLEGAL) The woman there has never finish high-school so they force there self or by there parent to get marriage like (contract marriage) under the law of the Philippines (DSWD) they trying there best to CUT this kind of WOMAN AND CHILD ABUSE So instead of judging them and blame then please study the whole story first and Don&#39;t blame them nor JUDGE them cause SOME OF THEM they don&#39;t want to make a SIN its just THERE FORCE TO MAKE A SIN FOR THE SAKE OF FOODS FOR THERE FAMILIES OR FOR THERE SELF. I also want to say here in Philippines I&#39;m not gonna lie here is MORE JUDGEMENTAL people jugde they&#39;re own blood Nation that make that girls lost there self confidence. SO PLEASE INSTEAD OF JUDGING THEM NOR OUR OWN COUNRTY IF YOU WANT TO HELP POOR CITIZENS IN PHILIPPINES YOU CAN GIVE WHATEVER it is With your open heart. I know some of you reading my comments wouldn&#39;t understand cause there you we&#39;re born on rich country in rich family."
I run around like a maniac when I&#39;m 12
This is why education is important.
"I am a Filipina, but I knew about s3x before I was even a teenager. I knew about contraceptives too, because my mom was on pills. It&#39;s kind of confusing for me to know that there are teenagers who do not know about these. Contraceptives are a bit more acceptable nowadays and the age of consent has been raised. I just hope education becomes more accessible, even to those who can&#39;t afford to go to school."
I wish I could hug all of these young girls. My heart hurts so much :(
Even contraceptives such as pills are kept in the healthcare centers instead of giving it to women especially teenage mothers if this country is not a rotten as the mindset of the people. I think this country will just have millions of people in another decade even they say that in 2040 the Philippine economy will be better and the people have a better life.
"This claim that the age of consent of 12 is wrong. The actual age is 18 for sexual activity with a women, and the government is very strict in summoning and locking people up in jail for this crime.  the media is lying and making up BS.  My wife is from dagupan PH, and her family were very strict with their daughter in having a relationship with me.  Her father would never allow us stay stay in the same room until she was married to me in her  mid 20&#39;s. When seeing this video clip on here, she said its BS, and its only a small number of bad parents that push the children into doing this behaviour."
Because Church is opposing reproductive health which as to lessen the Child birth
"This is prime example that abortion bans don‚Äôt stop abortions, they stop safe abortions."
"I know that life is sacred but will you take that child to suffer with you instead of choosing to be practical? Remember, it‚Äôs not the child‚Äôs fault to live, it‚Äôs either your will or others. If i‚Äôm in this messy situation, i‚Äôll just simply abort the child before it grows inside me cause I don‚Äôt want to drag her with me in this shith*le. To lessen poverty in this country, they should start to implement no child policy for the poor since they don‚Äôt have anything to feed for themselves in the first place."
Sicko need education them
This is disgusting and reality talk....
This makes Phil dig into poverty a burden to  Society and govt budget...and bec of poverty arise prostition and crimes.... Now tell me where is hope for this country if this is not being issued...
The Catholic Church has a big gianourmous influence over the people of Manila. Their religious rehtoric/discourse is against the contraception pill. <br>They make it a sin for women to take the contraceptive pill and or to encourage their children to take it. Every car in Manilla has a Catholic religious icon hanging from its rear view mirror. <br>Religion has made this country what it is today....how sad these beautiful people in this country were conditioned by Catholicism.
Omg
"It happens in the U.S. to teens as early as 12 yrs leaves with the family of their boyfriends. Their family are ok with it. The on difference is that their the same age, and their given contraceptives and reminded to take the. That way they dont get pregnant. So this person doing this report is just exploiting the people in this video."
The most severe stockholm syndrome is when Filipino proudly call their country as Philippines and themselves as Filipino
The world is a very cruel place I felt very bad seeing this with that smiling girls
"Scared of the contraception&#39;s side effects, yet isn&#39;t scared of the side effects of not using one, which are kids and responsibility. What in the actual fvckery is this."
HAAAAAAYS PILIPINAS ANONA  NAKAKAHIYA:((((((((
Sounds like a branch of industry
"had contraceptive developed since beginning, cain would have not been born. hahaha..."

"The embarrassed celsius conventionally dust because captain extremely mark along a damaging skin. adorable, clear hour"
Uneducated poor girls and extreme Catholicism.  The church should take responsibility for do many destroyed lifes. Disgusting
"The age of consent is 12??? Are you kidding me? That is the age a child is still busy playing games with friends without even proper idea about what they want to become when they grow up. This is downright sick. This country is seriously suffering from lack of education, false beliefs and too much interference from the church in the name of God and what is right per se the religion"
She wasn‚Äôt too young to get marry but was too young to talk about contraception?
Oh god! No protection. It sounds like STI/STD breeding ground.
"Maybe these conservative Americans should move to the Philippines since they feel the same way about abortions, life, and babies. Also, the rights of women. It‚Äôs crazy!"

The brainwashing by a crazy religion not to use contraceptives is sickening
The brainwashing by a crazy religion not to use contraceptives is sickening
So the age of consent is 12 yet they need their parents consent to take contraceptives up until they are 18 years of age? How does that make any sense whatsoever?
at 12 I didn&#39;t even know how kids are born and they are having kids at 12 surprising
Age of consent is 12years? This blows my mind. This is sick.
"Dude i&#39;m a Filipino And Even I Didn&#39;t Know that The Age of Consent Here is 12, Wtf?"
The Catholic religion in America is different than the Philippines I don&#39;t understand how 12 is legal that&#39;s crazy.
6.09 looks like child labour.
They cab still breed.  We have lost that ability here
Christian missionaries have ruined the world
"That government official is terrifying to watch. The way he talks about women, like livestock, ugh."
"Poor country has a large population from high birthrate,...rich country has a low birthrate...same as my expectations..."
in conclusion...men
China has a declining population problem also South Korea and Japan that&#39;s why I think it is good that Filipinos must spread out to the countries with declining populations.
"the world has already underpopulated...japan is dying.....soon the western world will be experience underpopulation too. the philippines baby factory is not a problem, it is a solution. also babies born to young parents are beautiful. what they should do is to lower the entry age of legally to work. early responsibility for a young age so that grow old responsibly."
That government obviously don&#39;t care the rich are rich the poor are (poorer blaah to that government)
"the sad thing is when you are of marriageable and and capable but dont want kids, people criticize you and says &quot;you&#39;re never feel complete as a woman if you dont give birth&quot; <br><br> and would respond with &quot; its already there, let&#39;s just accept this&quot; when teens get pregnant. its scary how some people tolerate and promote teen pregnancy when they aren&#39;t capable of raising and providing the child"
"There&#39;s literally a tribe here where it&#39;s okay for middle-aged men to have 12 year old children as wives- multiple of them. Apparently it&#39;s allowed because it&#39;s the tribe&#39;s tradition. It&#39;s quite sad because when the children were interviewed, they stated that they&#39;d rather marry than have a proper education."
That&#39;s why third world countries remains as third world countries. Laws based in religion. Ridiculous. <br><br>fyi I&#39;m Brazilian and my country is also a third world one. With some similar laws about abortion too. Hate it here and feel bad for these beautiful girls in Philippines that aren&#39;t in under circumstances protected by their own home.
The US needs to send aid and help them create a law to stop this.
So sad.  That‚Äôs a very dirty country
"Premature birth from young girls is common and often results in low IQ children suited to believing Catholic doctrines, since IQ is inversely related to religiosity. As with Islam, the religious parasites have a vested interest in reducing the populations IQ."
I&#39;m glad I have strict parents.
I believe this is due to people in the top believe in demographic mirracles. More people mean more economic development potential.
Religion is just a cult that caught on.
The pressed western ppl in the comments üíÄ
One of the most corrupted country on earth where politicians and the church are in cohort in destroying these poor people&#39;s lives.

Tangina ni Kuya. Pati ba naman mic? Hahaha! Natural capabilities. Nice. ü§∑
Education. This country needs to focus on it more. All kinds of it. Especially reproductive. Blame the government for not doing more. Gising na mga tao! Tangina. Sobrang kulelat na tayo.
that is why abortion should be legal in the philippines

"This embarrassment led us to Filipinos cancelling ourselves, like &quot;I wish I hadn&#39;t became a Filipino&quot;, &quot;I hope I reincarnated on a different country&quot; or something like that. Education and environment people are living in is the real factor why this is happening."
pitiful......
Thanks for posting.  I now live in the Philippines and am very sadly aware of this.
She was 11 when she suffered from miscarriage. Tangina :(((
Having an Husband in very young age is a choice..not all like that kind if mind set even the parents..Also it&#39;s not the Goverment problem it&#39;s the Family problem they did not teach well there children to send to Shcool.
Philippines coutry need to real install system
"I&#39;m a Filipino, the abortion is not legalized in my country..Parents are responsible for their kids/ children, but unfortunately, more parents are irresponsible and not willing to send their children in school coz they don&#39;t want to spend much money for their education. Philippines is a democratic country..Giving too much freedom to your kids is not good."
Stop having kids if you can‚Äôt fukin feed them! I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt feel sorry for these people. The kids yes but why do you continue getting pregnant when you know you can‚Äôt feed these kids
Why is a 28 year old who is suspected of being even older than that sleeping with a 14 year old and he was married ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è wtf.  This is what happens when there‚Äôs a lack of education
My cousin got baby at 15 and the father she says is old man but now she&#39;s 22 she now 2 kids
Poverty is really bad...
why does it always have to be about contraception? the pull-out method works so great when guys know how to do it. just teach all the guys about it sheesh.
13 and 22? what
"I&#39;m a Filipino but I didn&#39;t know the legal age of consent here BEFORE WAS 12. Anyway, it has been changed to 16y/o"
i think this is very impossible to be changed and have solution for this issue because it&#39;s very normalize now in philippines. young pregnant girls are actually proud of themselves getting pregnant at young age and call it &quot;woke in reality&quot;/&quot;mulat sa realidad&quot;. nowadays every 12 year olds are getting pregnant and brag it on facebook üò≠
"&quot;They said contraception had side effects&quot;. <br><br>Really? Which one has more side effects, contraception or having five to eight children or more that you can barely afford to feed and provide adequate education? And the side effect of having multiple children is passed on to the next generation of the family! They do not want to use contraceptives but also do not have family planning.  These people don‚Äôt think about what the possible consequences will be in the future of their children and children who follow in the wrong footsteps of their parent and lack of government action for it! And they even have the urge to say ‚ÄúLife is hard‚Äù. This history just repeats itself!"
"This is why we need more progressive leaders, ones that are not limited to what their traditions have dictated for hundreds of years."

no child policy for those below poverty and one child policy for those below median income.
I remember with my pinoy friend..she have 6 children without married..6 children‚Äôs with different father..
I‚Äôm a foreigner who was raised and still live in the Philippines. Police cat call me. ALL THE TIME. Just analyze that.
These predators get them pregnant and abondon them
"The man should be arrested. The age of 12 for consent is criminal. Most of these men are nothing but predators. Many forces are responsible: lack of education, no prevention programmes, poverty, the church influence , no access to contraception . A lot to deal with"
That&#39;s so sad...........
Just like the title says  Philippines is a baby machine.
age of consent 12 and need permission to get contraceptives...are u kidding me...
Did I really hear a man say that &quot;I am sure UN ideas will be overturned in the future&quot; when she asked about the right of self-determination and ability of planning families? AM I HALLUCINATING???
it&#39;s more fun in the philippines

Chinese garters is called &quot;zero point&quot; in Singapore. i used to play this when i was young kid.
"What&#39;s sad to admit is Asians have such a high fertility that if 1 million miscarriages happened no one would noticed or care it wouldn&#39;t even be on the news just because of the east and south east Asian fertility. The fertility itself isn&#39;t bad just the numbers are so high that deaths are unnoticeable as well as pregnancies. You could genocide, starve out in famine and put a plague across east Asia on the coasts and sea of the Orient and kill 90% of the population. And 8 new people would replace every death do to fertility. In every mass genocide and famine in war in east asia like china happens they just have three times the population after the war than before the war.<br>China with the combination of one child policy, Deadliest wars in it&#39;s history for the last 120 years, enforced abortions, civil wars, invasions, migrations, and there is still a larger population today than 200 years ago.<br>That&#39;s fertility.<br>East Asians can breed and a million babies could die after a pregnancy and the population wouldn&#39;t of felt a bat in the eye and would go unnoticed. The pregnancies are so young. Like the population is so large they could fight the battle of the Sommes over and over again 30 times and the population would barely have a dint of change.<br>Pregnancies at age 12? These people are so fertile they can get pregnant in their 50s. <br>They can have a million miscarriages. And no one would notice. Just because of the sheer population size of Asia. <br><br><br>Which at the end of the day is also impressive.<br><br>Filipinos have more children than most peoples.<br>Want a big family marry a Filipino."
"Religion shouldn&#39;t meddle with women&#39;s lives. We need to legalize abortion and have easy access to contraceptives. The girls are suffering.Why do they even listen to priests and churches when the bible allows misogyny, rape, child abuse,slavery and many inhumane things."
"They are giving birth at a young age. After becoming a victim, the rest do not understand it?Or is it the culture of the Philippines?"
all this catholic rules/ abstinance and moral values are all hypocricy .... its time for the Philippines govt to look hard in the impact this bullshit catholic churches principles are doing to pilipinos as a whole
Batangina
I feel so grateful I live in America
age of consent should be 18.. any women pregnant before that age should be jailed
How about these lily white imperialistic racist take their butts back to where they came from. People of color don&#39;t need white supremacists racist NGOs telling them how to solve their problems. People of color can solve their problems for themselves. They are not stupid like these racists think. These racists use the exact same excuses that the western imperialistic Spain used to subjugate a nation of color into the Roman Catholic church.  The very church these racists are now laying blame on. Let the people of the country solve the country&#39;s problems. Stop western imperialistic white supremacists  racist interference.
That‚Äôs the reason why State and Church should be separated .

"if the philippines is free from the spaniards colonization, why are we still living by their rules? why did these girls refuse to have an abortion just because a BOOK says its murder??"

"The Philippines, basically a haven for Discord and Reddit moderators."
Blame those idiot &quot;man&quot;
"I am not condemning those young girls who got pregnant in a very tender age, but I  would say that I am lucky enough that during my teenage years, my parents constantly reminded us the importance of study first, that true love can wait and better future waiting ahead.They also instilled in our mind that once get pregnat in a early age, the cycle of poverty will be the same, If we want to change the cycle, break it via focus on education and never limit oneslife in one place for the world is wide."
"It is just the other side of the whole story. It is not the religion, law, or the belief of the people. Its poverty the lack of education of young children. You can&#39;t expect 100% support from the government, instead change the mindset, think for solutions and move forward."
"I see a pattern, everytime a religion is in charge you get overpopulation. <br>Catholic church in charge means abuse.<br>Islam in charge abuse<br>Christian churches abuse<br>Then, why follow archaic disgusting religions?"
"Fact:  The catholic church has so much money, it can end the poverty in the world. <br>Yet, doesn&#39;t. <br>They seem to like overpopulated poor countries, because they are the most faithful. <br>Disgusting <br>All religions are garbage. <br>The worse by far Islam.<br>But all are just fairytales"
This is why Phillipines is poor and will stay poor.<br>Living in a dump but having kids like is a joke.<br>Put an UID in all the girls.<br>Only to be taken out when they get an education <br>And the men have work and have stable job.
So heartbreaking to watch
The problem is the men. The have no self control. No consequences
In the NL the consent age is also 12 why dont we have this bullshit?
So bad really seeing young children destroying their future like that if you complete your studies you could have been someone so important to your community and your country instead of just keep doing such things
I have a friend from Philippines who&#39;s 15 and is a mother of 1 child 2 year of age.... I kinda feel sad for her.

"Why does all contraceptives such as pills or implants are on women where infact, a Man can impragnate a lot of woman in just a day while a woman can only be pregnant once in every 9 months."
This happen coz the leader of gov&#39;t did not focus on family planning.The church opposite the contraceptive methods.The question what the church do for this is the one reason not poverty but crimes.Even the church cannot follow the all  words of God there is also priest making bad works.Dicipline for Filipinos is best.

I am so sad to see this situation in philipina... I feel More pity than my country..... In my country 12 years old is not allowed to marry it is illegal... I am 31 years old still single... And my sister she getting married when she was 23 years old it should be legal government... Really feel sad. How if myself like that... ü§≤ But now is modern that&#39;s not allowed.... Maybe 50 years ago that is allowed but now NO...
I was a member of that youth camp thing. Looking back at it and in this video I realized that it is a cult. They preach about self love and although that is right the hints of homophobia disgust me
The church can do very little when it comes to handling young people who wants adventure.  .  Media nfluences young people morethan church or state.
What does a 12 yr old know about consent ??? This is sickening and sad .
STDs
I feel so bad for these women
Catholic weirdness in action
No. 1 reason why they are allowed to make as many kids as they want. Potential voters in the future. Philippine politicians treat Filipinos not as people but as commodities.
Government is sleeping there...
This is why Islam is the only solution to humanity.
It&#39;s so hard to seeing like this in my own country... How I wish I can come home soon and help teenagers in my place to be aware about teenage pregnancy...
Shocking and disgusting hearing that Guy from the Church! Christianity&#39;s only goal is to increase and spread their religion that&#39;s why the country isn&#39;t taking any action with regards to this matter!

child is indeed a blessing from Almighty God but Teenage pregnancy shouldn&#39;t be normalize.
Wish government take good care their kids
That is the problem with my country. It is very corrupt
"As I know they are too young already have a baby&#39;s.... one study as a nurse but get pregnant, give birth, how she can concentrate on her study? Yet she&#39;s already a nurse now, her daughter 7 years.  ....."
Thailand used to be like the Philippines before. But nowadays Thailand has an extremely low birth rate causing a severe labor shortage.
"Dear philippinos, what&#39;s going wrong with you?"
"I am so embarrassed to admit that I did not know that the legal age of consent for a sexual relationship in the Philippines is 12 y/o.<br><br>Ever since I became aware, any engagement of sexual activity with a minor will warrant a penalty as it is ILLEGAL.<br><br>Social awareness in the Philippines should be raised about this so the law can be changed for the better. I did my research and this law has not been changed since 1930 and has met opposition when it was requested to be ammended. I do not really know how the minds of the politicians in our country works.<br><br>Anyway, the country is trying to increase the age from 12 to 16 which in my opinion is still not good. It shouls be atleast raised to 18 y/o. But I hope it will atleast be raised because I do agree with everyone, 12 y/o is still a CHILD and CHILDREN should always be protected from unjust practices."
Um the fact that a 13 yo girl feels guilty about having a miscarriage at 11??? What!! That‚Äôs ridiculous why are they brainwashing kids to feel like that
How is one attracted to a child? At 12 most girls are shaped like SpongeBob and don&#39;t even know how to clean themselves properly half the time.
All human born given the freewill to choose.. the choice leads to the life we have..
"As a Filipino, I didn&#39;t know that the legal consent here is 12 yrs. old and I think most of Filipinos didn&#39;t know that and would disagree."
I&#39;ve seen the hospital filled with mom&#39;s on a film in C1 <br> I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be called a baby factory
This isn&#39;t representative of the whole of Philippines. Why are they showing just this part??!
the kid looks like kathryn bernardo on her earlier years
Sinong nandito dahil sa english? HAHAHAHAHA
"the middle-class kids look so smart,  and intelligent, good-looking, and well-mannered. this just goes to show that environment is everything. funds matter."
"Wow, Bellin Is making bank over there. Lol Bellin is a joke."
"As a Filipino, I believe catholic churches should not meddle in government affairs same reason why churches don&#39;t pay taxes. do your thing let the government do theirs."
"That priest is one of the reason why the Philippines&#39; population is exploding. In short, the Catholic Church, is one of the root cause why the country is in crisis and finds it hard to improve."

"This is why everyone should experience the &quot;talk&quot; it&#39;s much safer when someone knows what&#39;s waiting for them at the end of the tunnel, it&#39;s safer that way and people, especially the parents shouldn&#39;t be ashamed of having that kind of conversation with their children. like seriously guys, prevention is better than cure.<br>thou Abstinence is a much better choice."

OBGYN recommending comprehensive contraceptive and sexual education to prevent teenage pregnancy. Meanwhile the vice governor of a province with no medical background is recommending abstinence only education. Sounds about right.
"We need to keep in touch with the Shekinah that&#39;s the only solution.<br><br>It ain&#39;t right micharages, poverty for those who don&#39;t abort. This ain&#39;t going in the right direction"
"If any are out there that want to help, please consider Philippines (a often forgotten country) needing help a reverting nation left and neglected by the West."
"The West has forgotten Philippines<br>A country that has been an ally in WW2, Vietnam and Korea yet ignored and shunned by America and the West.<br>Philippines cannot cross to Europe like Africans and Middle Eastern nations. They are left isolated unable to seek refuge.<br>The West gave and still give more aide to countries like China, India countries that are Nuclear super powers, have progressive industries and a brighter future.<br>In 1 year Vietnam receives more aide than Philippines in 10 years. <br>No wonder Philippines is being left behind, rampant corruption and a plethora of new and evolving problems some of which is poverty, violence and this rampant unethical procreation."
"Funny how Foreign aid  still goes to countries that are:<br>Already a Nuclear Super Power (willingly spending more on arms) like China and India, <br>Recent enemies of the West (Japan/Vietnam) and <br>Countries that have negative views of the West (Middle East nations like Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon etc) aggressors and Non allies of the West<br><br>Meanwhile Philippines (former colony of the West, current ally, ally in significant wars) is forgotten and neglected. <br>Lesson: Loyalty does not pay and there is more leverage when not an ally or loyal state."
ONe westerner equals three Filipinos.     Filipinos consume food and produce wastes  1/3 only of foreigners.   so 100 million Filipinos equal only 33  million foreigners.
Hurray for religious indoctrination in schools. The preacher telling them to say it louder repeatedly gives me shivers
remove the damned translation! it makes it harder for us to understand what they are really saying!
It&#39;s really crazy.
"I AM A FILIPINO BUT I DIDN&#39;T KNOW UNTIL NOW THAT THE AGE OF CONSENT HERE IS AS YOUNG AS 12! LIKE WTF. When I was 12, I&#39;m still playing paper dolls. Glad my parents sheltered and guided us the right path."
"Teenage pregnancy very rampant in Philipines  but if the our Philippine Government won&quot;t do act NOW, Philippine Government will  future diffulties more teenage pregnancies. Hoping Our Government act now not tomorrow. HOY GISING"
The church doing churchy things still
There should be separation of state and the church. Yes to RH BILL
very bad...From... Bangladesh
Religion needs to be separated from government
The funny sentence in this video.&quot;We believe in our innate capability to control ourselves rather than contraceptives&quot;.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=6m52s"">6:52</a> that women is a idiot. She would have caused a lot of trouble for that girl and her family."
"aii I literally had to stop the video, AGE OF CONSENT AT 12 ??????"
See  how religious indoctrination can ruin a whole society.
Abortion is murder.  It is pure evil.
Am already 15 and am still watching Anime / Tom and Jerry / SpongeBob with no interest in dating because for me I see at as just a waste of time and I would rather focus in my school and get a decent job.
"BRUH, I&#39;m from PH but I didn&#39;t knew the age of consent is 12! That&#39;s a grade 6 student we are talking about here! I&#39;m 24 and I can&#39;t even manage to take care of myself."
"From this video, it looks like all the NGOs want to do is have charges pressed."
"i feel sad for meimei. she has a sweet smile and she deserves to live happily like other kids, playing with her other friends, and being taken care of by her parents, in at least a healthy environment. too bad that not everyone get to live a life like that. having a miscarriage at such very young age, and even worse, blame herself for that? <br><br>if I&#39;m in her shoe, would i ended up in the same fate as her? how would I know on how to live a better life than that? I&#39;m scared if I couldn&#39;t think enough for myself, and keep on being taken advantage of."

Legal consent at 12??? Are you sure?? Tama ba intindi ko sa intro? Hahahha. Sinong matinong magulang ang magcoconsent sa batang 12yrs old na makipag anuhan??

Watching this in women‚Äôs international day is very disappointing üòî
Age of legal consent is TWELVE??? THAT&#39;S WRONG!
Amazing ignorance and denial reflected in how poor and miserable the country is.
"The thin file covalently trust because house methodically tame across a precious saxophone. ruddy, abandoned trouble"
So in a nutshell as a human race we send robots to far away in search for spec&#39;s of life sign&#39;s and yet in abortion clinics specifically in the USA they dont recall a fetus of a sign of life.
"Im a filipino and so blessed to be living in the UK and having sufficient education and awareness and resources for all these issues. i am so sad for my birth country since not a lot is being done. Because of corruption and greediness, many people suffer. Philippines needs to be educated more, bless them"
"12 yrs old?? age of consent? oh god, thats screwed up.. still a child just starting puberty... this should be a crime. period."
"As a Filipino Young adult, I can attest these things happen. My cousing got her first baby when she was 14 years old, she stopped schooling and did not even graduate high school. It&#39;s 2021 now, and she now has 5 kids, and a 2nd live in partner, and she is so poor like dont have anything to eat everyday poor, and just asks aunties, and yes us cousins for money.<br><br>And with the RH (Reproductive Health) Law still in shambles because of blinded opposition by the pro-life and church, so many are in the shoes of my cousin. When RH Law was during its battle for being a legislation, I remember going to church and always hearing the priests using the homily just to ingrain that RH, contraception etc are sins. And abstinence is the only way. It&#39;s so appalling what super fixation on religion, and misguided politics can do to a nation.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a devout Catholic, and a graduate of a Catholic School but to limit options for contraception, family planning, and to say and  outright that RH Law and lessons on reproductive health, sexuality lessons are not needed is just idiotic."
"REPENT.<br>REPENT.<br>SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.<br>SHAME, SHAME, SHAME."
"shameless,22 year old with an 11 year old he be in prison here"
Poor social culture and laws make this happen
i applaud Bahrain for making the age consent the highest in the world of age 21
Abortion is murder
That guy is a waste of space
If this guy was in Brazil <br>They would get jailed
I really hate philippines for tolerating those teens to get a family at a small age and normalizing teenage pregnancy ew
These girls or just these people in general are living in such poor conditions with poor beliefs. I really wish things were different
One of our topics in school is how catholic groups are so againts the reproductive health law says a lotüòÄ

All the American s who are not getting laid must be feeling jealous
"Its crazy how laws differ from country to country. In the USA if an adult dates a teen girl he is considered a pedo and is sent to jail for the rest of his life and if he does it in the philippines, its considered totally normal? Its crazy how its ok to do something in one country and its totally allowed(legal) in another. I wonder what we can do here in the USA thats considered illegal(not allowed) in other countries?"
Poor children
It&#39;s all good and natural.. .. just do it...
It&#39;s all a dream..
Catholic  church equals  hate organization
How can pro life  people  justify  forcing  this misery and suffering  onto  children  who were raped .  How can anyone feel  their ideology  is more important  than  the suffering that ideology inflicts on young girls living in poverty.  Its another way  the catholic  church is  helping facilitate pedophilia.  It seems the catholic church truly hates  children.
How much evidence  do people need before they  realize  abstinence  does not work .
I would say that this bullshit Catholic religion is really bullshit
Oh.My.Gosh the age is 12?! thats insane im Filipino but im  living in another country this is insane I&#39;ve always been a bit scared of my own country and this makes me even more sad<br><br>when they said that the CFC(Couples For Christ) is helping i was soo happy cuz me and my family are part of the community but instead in this country
Make free sterilization
This is happening right now. i have no reason to doubt this vids authenticity. My question is why aren&#39;t the feminist women of America and the world on the next flight to protest and put a stop to this?????? Anyone???
This &quot;teenage pregnancy problem&quot; sure sounds more like a child rape problem to me- with the pregnancy as a consequence for the victims.
"The problem is rape and the solution is to educate men to hold their desire before they have means to suppor their wives and families, yet the people of the world always blame the state and the church for not allowing contraceptives and abortion. Funny :&#39;)"
"The dying west should really keep their hands off the Philippines. The country is not a baby factory, this is the healthy reproduction curve of a sustainable human society. The epidemic of abortion, contraception, and feminism in western countries is making their populations age faster than a normal lifetime. In 100 years their population pyramid would collapse (too many elderly too few fertile adolescents). The Philippines will maintain a healthy population for hundreds more years because families are still formed there. So back off."
Abstinence does not work.
Go home liberal/lefty/athiest white fake news physco.<br>we all know your sneaky agenda.<br>you pretend to care but would abort all those children you secular hypocrite..go home.
"we need to relearn the design of the human body. even lower intelligent animals know when the female body is ready for pregnancy. our society had been corrupted by the movie and entertainment industry in promoting sexuality. it is complicated by the use of mind altering substances, ignorance, and poverty to provide security for our women. capitalism, dirty politics, and religion are the most prevalent cause of dehumanization."
"The most religious countries are the most corrupted, easily deceived and manipulated. Religion teaches blind faith and obedience. it stops people from thinking and learning. so many members of the clergy have committed so many sexual crimes and they are rarely punished."
Malaysia is heading towards this direction. Well done
That was nice of him to step up and be responsible even though he&#39;s dead wrong with putting her in that situation
Dota2 probably saves some of the boys from becoming irresponsible father
Western feminazi&#39;s get out of the Philippines.
Who is this woman who talks bringing charges against a man that is taking care of a girl with whom he has had a child?  Is she from the Philippines?
"They come in without a blood pressure, without a pulse, and you have to treat them. No BP no pulse....you mean dead? I hope that was a translation error."
Are they not aware that condoms exist
Az they talk..with the smile..its seem they like it....not judge them...poor corrupt goverment and police......what kind of institution is there..
LACK OF EDUCATION IS THE PROBLEM. üòî
"Everyone must be aware that Woman can only carry a child for 9 months (at a time), while man can make any woman pregnant (as many as he can)  anytime. So educating on both gender should be balanced and crucial don&#39;t just focus on woman."
TVB USA Official
This makes me feel guilty not having kids
"omg our govt is messed up. im a devout Catholic, but i rlly think we should keep the church and state separate."
So I heard someone saying something like &quot;And I&#39;m here watching Anime&quot; (just a guess) and someone replied &quot;Not everyone is as lucky as you..&quot; THAT&#39;S WRONG! A CHILDHOOD SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EVERYONE! This literally explains how a child marriage can ruin someone&#39;s childhood..
The solution is one child per couple just like China. That&#39;s why Philippines is a poor country because of all this children .
There must be a law for men/boys to be put in jail when they prey on minors. There are many predator men in Philippines. PRRD should have included to stop these evil men. Every corner in Philippines has teenage girls getting pregnant every year.
Thats why s*x educ is important

"Age of consent at the age of 12? I&#39;m 25 and my parents still check on me telling me if I go out with my friends and stay out late at night, my father would literally told me, don&#39;t you dare come home. You a**hole."
You don‚Äôt hear about any girls getting pregnant by their classmates...I‚Äôm sure it happens but still seems like a lot of advantage being taken there by older guys. My heart breaks for these girls.
I‚Äôm sorry did he say age of consent is 12?üöÆüöÆüöÆ
"Chastity doesn‚Äôt work. Look at the US and the Church states. High teen pregnancy. Education, condoms, and contraceptives. STDs are bad"
The sad thing in Philippines is they cannot accept this tragedy and being blind of it. They have this stubborn attitude. I hope they change this.
Education cannot reach those who does not go to School or  really not listening in class and kids that cannot control themselves. Others reason is teens rebellion and vices.
"I don&#39;t care about cultural norms, I don&#39;t care about tradition, I don&#39;t care. 12 should not be the age of consent. 12 is a child."
"That extreme cathlic man... What he just said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=11m55s"">11:55</a> ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ"

PLEASE LETS NOT HAVE CONSERVATIVE RELIGOUS PEOPLE ON AUTHORITY
"bruh i lost my respect when they said girls can married at the age of 12, straight to jail!"
The way this child thinks its her fault because she thinks its a sin to god tsk tsk tsk
What?  12?? I thought the age of consent was 18 years old?  I&#39;m a Filipino but I didn&#39;t know that it was 12.
It&#39;s not about how important contraceptives its about control.
I live in a pretty conservative community and all the places that teach abstinence only have the highest teen pregnancy rates this method continues to be debunked I don&#39;t know why all these Church people cannot accept that.

"It&#39;s so sad that these women hasn&#39;t realized that they too can have a say about having a baby, and not just that because their partner wants to have one. They don&#39;t need to satisfy these abusive men to survive. They too can be happy on their own."

"I&#39;m sorry for your experience Yoonserissi98! Your government has failed you royally and should be held accountable. You have provisions for this in your Constitution which is copied from the US Constitution! Your President is less efficient than Trump! It seems to me that your biggest problems are lack of sexual education, leadership, and government corruption. Get the BBC and any other media stream to publicize this. Ask Pope Francis and the Church to launch an investigation and help you. Good luck and God Bless."
"I live in a rural area here in the philippines and i&#39;ve met and become acquianted, even relatives with girls kind of similar in the video. Its a sad reality- My aunt got raped and had 9 kids with her rapist who eventually became her husband forcefully, my cousin of two years older than me got pregnant at 15-16 and gave birth a few months back, my childhood friend also is in the same situation as my cousin. My family tries our best to help but sometimes we can only do so much :/"

"A lot of guys in the Philippines does target younger girls and it seems to be normal for everyone. I remember when I was in senior high and most classes consists of teenagers age 16 to 22 yo, most guys would try and get with the freshmen girls which are usually 13 yo but can be as young as 11. And when they go to college they would go for high school girls. I thought it was normal until I moved over seas and finally saw that it was wrong and disgusting"

This is a load of feminist bullshit.
"this is why poverty is a crime - it breeds an endless cycle of malignant ignorance, social injustices and governments and institutions that do not care about the welfare and future of its peoples."
"Story: My Brother Had a her Girlfriend Stay With us Because Our House is closer to her School and my dad Dont know how to refuse so he said Yes, Not time Long My brother Got His Girlfriend Pregnant then sooner we found our that He Have 2 Girlfriends Both Got them pregnant GF 2 Dropped her Baby GF 1 (The Girl Staying at our house) Gave birth Not Too long my Sister (Who Runaway Cause She Felt Like She was Being mistreated By our Parents, Me and My sister Are Very Close! And i didnt See Her being Mistreated to the point They Hurt Her Physically i think she only felt that way Because Dad Wasnt Really Fond Of Her Being a Writer And Didnt Really showed support Left Our House And Lived With his Boyfriend Whos Still living with his Family But ofc With its own room) Came Back To Us Saying shes Pregnant And Tht she&#39;ll be needing to stay With us For a While Because She and her Boyfriend Kept on fighting With Finances. <br>Btw My Brother is 21 His Gf Is 18 And Her other Gf( The One Who Drop the Child before birth) Is 19<br><br>{Sorry its Confusing It hard to explain crazy Story}"
That&#39;s what excessive poverty does to people.
It&#39;s not good so sad üò•
Where is governance ingenuity? Where is government?
I&#39;m sorry to say this but it&#39;s also their parents fault why they ended up like that.
My brother 19 im 17 my parents wouldn&#39;t even allowed us to stay outside at 7pm 6pm you should be in the house. My brother still haven&#39;t experience sleepovers and so am I. But I&#39;m happy of how our parents handles and concern for us tho. I&#39;m not complaining
"With the age of consent being so catastrophically and dangerously low, u would think condoms were given out for free. <br>Stop blaming the poor for having children they cant afford. Thats classist and elitist. <br>Start blaming whoever isnt protecting these people from worsening their situation. Its all systematic."
God dosent blame her! She didn&#39;t kill her baby its not her fault. God loves you hes with you and he supports you. And screw these pedophilles who rape young women it needs to be stopped
Parang nakakahiyang maging Pilipino. Katabi lang ng simbahan ang mga hayop na nag-aalok ng pampalaglag. Mga tunay na demonyo!

"White woman put on a mask trying to be a social justice warrior, that&#39;s very hypocritical."
The Philippines will forever be stuck in poverty if they do not resolve their problem with contraception and family planning.
"The age of consent is 12 but to get contraceptive or HIV test you need your parents permission until 18, what kind of logic is this"
"It is a vicious cycle. When they are poor, it limits their access to education, information and contraception. The poor people become parents at young age. Their life quality is poorer because of the children. Their children face the same problem as their parents. The low age of consent and the limit for contraception and legal abortion made it worse."
A 28-year old got a 14- year old pregnant?! <b>That&#39;s straight up criminal.</b>
"Church be dammed. 12 year old girls should not be having babies!!!! Especially with older &quot;boyfriend&#39;s&quot; who let me be honest, are pedophiles."
the way these teens are being taught in school is so sad. a man and a woman are not the only ones who can be one. chastity isn&#39;t everything. God will always love His children no matter what. there&#39;s no exception to those who have supposedly &quot;sinned&quot; by aborting their fetus.
The U.S. has the highest rate of rapes. Why not deal with the issues in your own backyard. Hypocrites...
what al jazeera should reporting is about the treatment of filipino workers in the hands of arab employers
News flash! Hypocrites on the loose!
I‚Äôm Catholic but I don‚Äôt agree with their stance on contraception!

If she don‚Äôt wanna keep e child n be reminded of e incident, I will respect it<br><br>I don‚Äôt think this is just a Philippine problem, other parts of e world have similar issue"

"Just because you can afford to spend your precious time doing tiktok doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re life is heading to any success. Philippines is the number 1 country in Asia that has 98 Million fame slaves to tiktok but still succumb to put food on the table. Many of them are young, who are let alone with their phones and no interest in going to school because they got babies at just 14 years old."
its not poverty its ignorance!
Why they used to get married at the young age   and why there parents are not controling their children...I fel pity for them...
Those young people need to be educated an start to use contraceptive because if they sexual active

"There is a seeming mistake here, 12 is not the legal age of consent in the Philippines"
Sounds like Children under the age of 18 years old being forced to marry the man who brutally raped them who is in their 30s<br>And now trapped with the Rapists offspring<br>financially struggling and depressed
"it is 12 years old the age of consent in The Philippines, however if your under the age of 18 years old and pregnant that is rape and sexual assault."
I am a filipino but i hate be apart of this world...
<b>PROUD TO BE PINOY</b>
Bruh this is the reason why we need to stop religion indoctrinate their bullshit inside the classroom. The only thing they do is make people feel bad to something they can&#39;t control and blatantly giving false information. Contraceptive is bad because they believe that people can control their urges? give me a break. The only thing it do is make people feel bad and avoid buying it and what it will cause more suffering to the children.
"wait, age of consent here is 12? I thought it was 18 lol"
This is heartbreaking to see.
"Philippines must have 1 family 1 child policy! Overpopulation leads to poverty, pollution, traffic, etc. Philippines is indeed a baby factor üòÖ"

"Honestly, religious nuts will go and say that &quot;abortion is against the bible&quot; when the bible has not said anything about abortion! <br><br>&quot;And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth . . .&quot;--Ex. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=21m22s"">21:22</a>-25<br><br>The bible orders the death penalty for murder of a human being, but not for the expulsion of a fetus.<br><br>When does life begin?<br><br>According to the bible, life begins at birth--when a baby draws its first breath. The bible defines life as &quot;breath&quot; in several significant passages, including the story of Adam&#39;s creation in Genesis 2:7, when God &quot;breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&quot; Jewish law traditionally considers that personhood begins at birth. Therefore, the commandment &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; does not apply to an embryo or a fetus, as it is not considered a human being. The Mosaic law in Exodus 21:22-25, directly following the Ten Commandments, makes clear of this.<br><br>Before you use the bible as an excuse, make sure that you have actually read it."

"I‚Äôm a Filipino but I live in Canada. Sometimes my family and I fly over to the Philippines to visit my nanay (Grandmother) and my cousins. Last I remember there were maybe 15 boys just from my mothers side, and on my father there‚Äôs even more. I mostly stay around the females because I don‚Äôt feel safe around the men because they acted so weirdly and I had seen a lot of really like uh.. I can‚Äôt even find the words for it but I hope you know what I mean. I was maybe 11 the last time I visited them and I remember how whenever they would play games on their phones they would name them self‚Äôs ‚Äúfuckboys‚Äù because I think they thought they sounded cool. I was scared around them. It felt bad that I was scared of them but at the same time I was proud that I knew to stay away from things like that."

"Anatomically, physiologically, emotionally a 12 yr old is never ready..."

"What people need are facts and truth, as these women and men in the Philippines truly need from caring people, such as those who belong to the church (not necessarily separated from &quot;the state&quot;)."
Did a little more research and see that &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; is indeed indicated as a propaganda pusher. This was mentioned Wikipedia. People don&#39;t need those who are biased telling them what to think.
"I watched this manipulative video with an open mind. First and foremost, the problem presented is clearly needing a healthy solution. However, after awhile, realized the propaganda being pushed for &quot;contraception&quot; being the solution over the ignorance that is clearly the issue. Then further into this video, seeing the propaganda and excuse used for a &quot;separation of church and state&quot;, when clearly it&#39;s politics that is the problem, when actually what these people need is truth. They need people who care, not people to use them for pushing propaganda as indicated in this video."
"I‚Äôm Catholic too, but honestly some of our traditional ways are ignorant!! Abortion is one thing, but please give those kids contraceptives!! I would personally donate money, if they did that."

Soo all thiss  foren organizacion  in cauntrys like this live like kings....
This is why to much belief are bad for a country <br>Specially in the Philippines and<br>Illegal abortion!! That&#39;s just stupid <br>No wonder Philippines are one of the most populated country they should have a purge
The issue here is peoples SINFUL NATURE.
"These happens in poverty stricken areas for two reasons: 1)these kids&#39; parents allowed/pushed them to marry young to relieve them one financial burden; 2) the kids themselves wanted to escape that poverty only to end up poorer than ever. <br>On a moral sense however, these kids were not taught values, they are mostly hanging out in the streets from morning til morning. Their parents simply did not care or are too busy making a living to check on their kids. Most of these kids also came from broken families."
These ppl need to understand that being catholic worshipping god is not a reason to not take contrapositive. i really feel sorry for these ppl.

Population control is not working in the Philippines because both the Church and politicians need more people to get more money. Come 50 years later and I don&#39;t know what will happen when Manila traffic is no longer moving and resources cannot support more millions of mouths.

"‚Äúall human life is good...‚Äù yeah but that shouldn‚Äôt be the reason why a lot of teenagers are becoming parents and their children suffering... all respect to their religious beliefs, we should also do our part in educating them about sexual intercourse, the consequences, and contraceptives to prevent a ‚Äòhelpless‚Äô life. a child‚Äôs life is a blessing, sure, but it‚Äôs still better for them to know what they‚Äôre getting themselves into. all life SHOULD be a good life"
"Parents consent at the age of 12 ,its not true"
Im 14 year old turning 15 next year while watching this im pretty glad i broke up to my 16 year old boyfriend ( yes i know im to young to be in a relationship) I was to eager to have a relationship so without hesistant i accept his love we have been toghter for like almost 9 months but i broke up with him since he has been asking to me to have an unprotected s3x   thats why i broke up with him.
Ignorance is not bliss
Very nice‚Ä¶.
"11?! Geez thats horrible.<br>At that age I was running around with makeshift sticks swordfighting with other kids, or playing flash games on the internet.<br>Kids at such a young age should be enjoying their childhood, and seeing the bright side of the world.<br>Not being married off<br><br><br>The sad thing is that our country isn&#39;t much better considering that our age of consent is 18, but kids are still doing &quot;it&quot; at ages like 11 and below.<br>The government needs to take a better watch over this stuff so teenagers stop giving themselves away without being old enough.<br>But if that happens, people would definitely riot about privacy, so I&#39;m not sure of a solution.<br>If anything, I feel like kids should be separated by gender in school, for an easier way to prevent mishaps.<br>As well as teachers of the same gender, so there are no pedo attacks, or a lot of cameras in the school."
They tell them protection will hurt the females what bullshit is that 12 .12 you should be in your bed or bothering your mom like what I‚Äôm 12 and I have not even hold a boys hand but having kids at 12. And you have no education about and the parents won‚Äôt tell them about it because it‚Äôs weird
Wow.
Education is important knowledge specially this day everyone need to know what is importance of family planning what will be the future of your children be in the future.
Religious or not abortion is murder. You don‚Äôt get to take another persons life.

Legal age of consent is 18 years old in the Philippines since 1987. Correction please.
"I&#39;m a filipina and I didn&#39;t know that 12 is the age consent because as far as I know It&#39;s 18! I&#39;m already 19 but my parents still control my life to the point of Having a time limit, I can&#39;t even go out without their consent but I&#39;m fine with it.

"They need parenting consent thats all. . .when im in teenage day my mother is strict to me and to my sister , and im thankful for that . .not all teenager in the philippines are  like them. . ."
Why is age of consent 12?!? No wonder the country is booming in children having babies. Young girls are being washed in the hopes of wanting a perfect boyfriend and wanting out of the diar situation they are living in. Disgusting that older boys/men are taking advantage of them.
A fetus is not s human being

This is one side of Philippines that I feel ashamed about. That&#39;s one reason why the cycle of poverty is never broken. The church must be separate from the state.
"I think the mother there needs to be reached about condoms...<br><br>If you&#39;re worried about your daughter using pills because it can give hormonal side effects, just give her a condom..."

"GrandMa-Filipino DonnaCamT. here.<br><br>According to Genesis 15: 7-14, God told Abram that he and his people where brought out to take possession of a foreign land. At first in a sacrifice Abram fought and drove vulture birds of prey away. But when Abram fell into a deep sleep God revealed a dream vision of terror saying that his descendants will be enslaved as strangers and mistreated in the land. So if we seek God without distraction and endure against the vulture birds of prey like Abram, after four hundred years God will punish them.<br><br>Ayon sa Genesis 15: 7-14, sinabi ng Diyos kay Abram na siya at ang kanyang mga tao kung saan ay naglabas upang kumuha ng isang banyagang lupain. Sa una sa isang sakripisyo ay nakipaglaban si Abram at tinaboy ang mga buwitre na ibon na biktima. Ngunit nang matulog si Abram ng mahimbing na tulog ay nagsiwalat ang Diyos ng isang pangarap na pangitain ng takot na sinasabing ang kanyang mga kaapu-apuhan ay magiging alipin bilang mga hindi kilalang tao at malupit sa lupain. Kaya&#39;t kung hahanapin natin ang Diyos nang walang paggambala at magtiis laban sa mga buwitre na ibon na biktima na tulad ni Abram, pagkatapos ng apat na raang taon ay parurusahan sila ng Diyos."
"The Philippine government funded a reproductive health program which sells affordable contraception which ive been using since i was 14. I learned about it through research, have I not taken the initiative, I will never know about it. We need more education and to repeal the age of consent up to 18. The population is growing and many become parents before they are ready, therefore, our poverty rates is consistent. I honestly don&#39;t know why the Catholic Church still has any bearing to our laws because since the promulgation of our current constitution, the separation of church and state is a clear cut policy"

THIS IS A SOCIAL AND CULTURAL &quot;PROBLEM&quot;<br>APPARENTLY POVERTY AND PEDOPHILIA GOES HAND ON HAND ALSO.
Gosh !!<br>I cant believe this!!
I just noticed how it is always men who disagree with contraception.
This is a clear cut case of child sexual molestation.  I believe the Government has more concerns than protecting these marginalised girls.  So sad!
Religion is harmful.
Who drove this Catholic country into dire poverty?  The FreeMasonic USA?
It still saddens me watching this again... Awareness is the key to resolve this issue and the Church not to keep mingling with issues like this...

"12! That&#39;s like a sick joke. And these are not &quot;boyfriends&quot;, they are paedophiles end off. I&#39;m sure he is &quot;proud&quot; off this relationship, but there&#39;s nowt 2 b proud about. And I&#39;m betting he didn&#39;t choose his g/f over his wife. But both he wanted 2 avoid conviction &amp;, or his wife made the decision 4 him. Sorry but the Catholic Church should be ashamed, off how much influence it has in the Philippines, &amp; the influence it has when it comes 2 contraception ect. As the church shouts that a person should not use contraception, &amp; have whoever many children they can. Even when it means these children are born in2 families ale in poverty. Struggling 2 feed family they have. But according 2 the Church they should still cont 2 &quot;multiply&quot;. And how tf it b OK on any level, u have an  age of consent at 12. But u can&#39;t get contraception or HIV test 4 another 6 yrs without permission. Having this age of consent, is making being a paedophile legal &amp; accepted. The government in the Philippines recognise there&#39;s a problem. Even on a larger scale, for their economy ect. But are to worried about going aga the Catholic Church in the country. They need to worry more about future generations of Filipinos, rather than a church allowing this to happen, 2 follow their rules. But providing no help 4 the inevitable consequences. NGOs must b totally overwhelmed by the situation there. And children are losing the future, b4 they&#39;ve barely started in life. Just so screwed up.."
Philippine&#39;s punishment is too light even old people can make a 12 year old pregnant and corrupt politician are running rampant because there is no serious punishment like the death penalty

And these evangelist trying to teach/ preach teenagers at high school with their archaic beliefs as dogma should be disallowed due to the harm they are causing to the future generation. People like these are the prime reason why Pinas is still a 3rd World Country. <br><br>No one is elevated in the country unless you are rich or lucky to leave the country of your birth or parents&#39; birth. If you are poor in the Pinas, you stay poor as the government do not care, do not protect and do not do things in the public&#39;s interest. They are in power to elevate themselves, and they ALSO parade their strength hypocritically through their Christian disguise. They should be removed from such positions and be thoroughly troubled by the pain they cause on the people who need proper education and support - not woo-woo beliefs!!<br><br><b>Church and state SHOULD be separated.</b>"

how can anyone watch this and be anti-choice? this is exactly what happens when your policies are implemented. it‚Äôs what would happen if planned parenthood (and similar organizations) were destroyed. <br><br>criminalizing abortion doesn‚Äôt stop abortions. it just stops safe abortions. it ruins lives and maims and kills. put you still claim to be ‚Äúpro life‚Äù
Can believe that a 10 or 1yr girl got a boyfriend and it&#39;s 22yr that&#39;s just nuts and weird
I sometimes forget that I&#39;m living in the same country that these girls are living. We often boxed ideas of teenage pregnancies as just sins committed by teenagers that are &quot;too curious&quot; and blames them. But the reality is there is much more to their story. The education system failed them the government failed them. Failed to educate them and help them stay in school. This is so disheartening
"Encourage everyone to have family planning ,"
"There are laws and awareness.but the question is, tumagagos ba ang implementions up to the grassroots level??"
Most corrupt religion- being catholic!!
"As a Filipino ....It&#39;s not the moral teaching of the Catholic Church who is to be blame. It&#39;s the Department of Education and the Corrupt Government Officials who are the primary caused of moral and material poverty in my country. Also, Philippines is under the control of Oligarchies (the rich elite and influenced people)  who financed  those corrupt politicians during elections and control them the moment they are in that position. In the Philippines, the state and the church are not united and don&#39;t mix them as if the Church controls the State. <br>Al Jazeera made this documentary to promote contraception and abortion by blaming the Catholic Church, but not touching the true cause of the  problem which is government corruption. Why? Coz they are just hypocrites as some mainstream medias are, like what these documentary is all about: HYPOCRISY!!!"
This is so depressing üò≠ I hope the situation will change there.
Catholic is very obsolete.  Good for them.. priest lived in a better place.  what do they do in regards to this conversation...
Too bad. They made thier choices.  They have to lived with the consequences.  beyond help..  Government wont help either.
"What? time change indeed.  I was born and raised in the philippines and I did not know that 12 years old can consent?  Until I left the philippines I lived with my parents and of course still had to ask permission to go out.  Cant blame though most goverment, rich people were too busy corrupting and stealing money, property from the poor people."

"As a filipino, I can say this is true and it&#39;s happening. 3/10 of the people you know can be either raped, had a miscarriage, or pregnant under the age of 25."

"Religion is a plague, you can&#39;t change my mind."
Sniffed too much paint thinner/solvent that their brains are as thin as a strain
Why is the age of consent 12 but the girls can‚Äôt get contraceptives on their own till 18. It‚Äôs like they want these young girls to get pregnant or have STD‚Äôs. Smfh ü§¨
Update : now the legal concent is 16
"I dont agree with &quot;controlling yourself&quot; no matter how much a parent or a priest or somebody say dont have sxe, they will eventually have sxe, and its wrong to just say abstinence is key, teenagers are curious and they want to experience many things and sxe is one of them, so its better to teach them how you can do it without the risk of having a baby, im not saying that we encourage them, im just saying when they decided to do it they should have access to contraceptive and knowledge before they do it"

lack of education and awareness are the reason why. as well as those people who are taking advantage of these teenagers. nakakagalit.
I&#39;m filipino and was suprised to know the age of consent is 12 years old most filipinos don&#39;t know that
I donno bt smthng is not gd in Philippines
that guy who said he&#39;s 28 but looked like 40 is so disgusting
This is why I am so unpatriotic to my blood country.
the title hurts ..<br>i dont even know that 12 is the age of consent now ...
I&#39;d say the Catholic Church is up to its old tricks again.  Turning a blind eye to human suffering and exploitation.
"Stop blaming the church for the abortion being illegal and be honest, it&#39;s the sexual assault! it&#39;s RAPE! Charge the pedophiles!"
Anooo?! Mae-mae 14 years old tapos inaakan sya ng jowa niyang 22 years old nung 11 years old sya? Kumukulo dugo ko kay kuya. Galing manguto ng bata ah?
"I was a filipina who has been engage to a stranger at a young age (9y/o) without my knowledge; Or should i say without our knowledge.  They said we will get marry when we reach the age of 18. But now i&#39;m 26 and he is 29 but we didn&#39;t get marry.  <br>I have my own life so as him.  <br>We&#39;re friends too unlike when we were childrens, we never wanted to see each other."
"These people need someone to teach them about pedophilia, rape, mental abuse, emotional abuse and contraceptives, I pray these women get the help they so rightfully deserve and the boys are taught better and they raise the legal age!"
"I came from a broken family, luckily I was raised by my late grand father who taught me to be a good grand daughter and citizen, and actually it depends on how people took care of you and how they guide you. I am 23 now, with a boyfriend for 2 yrs , still we don&#39;t have plan to get married and even to have a baby."
"I&#39;m from Philippines , 23 years of age and I am proud to say that I graduated from college and I don&#39;t still have baby .. I am also sad to see some teenage moms"
My partner is from the Philippines and I am older by two years (52) and her brothers when I am in the Philippines think I am nuts not going with the young single woman . When I mention i am not into  adult paedophilia they haven&#39;t a clue what I talking about. Still it could be worse girls marry at 7yrs in Yemen and many dont survive their wedding night
"They discourage women from using contraceptives, stating that they value life, yet they see so many kids and adults wallowing in heart wrenching poverty because of the serious imbalance of their society, and don‚Äôt care about their lives - the lives that are already ACTUALLY existing. <br>Great logic."
the backwardness of the church in these matters is just astounding. how is it possible that the church benefits from so much ignorance?
Philippines also has a lot of young paedophiles
12 isnt the age of consent in philippines. this documentary ia wrong
"Some years back I went to sharjah orphanage,  99% of children were Philipino,"
This is a rape.. I don&#39;t know why their parents allowed them to have a relationship in her early age..this is one of a big problem in Philippines.Too much liberated to not control their selves  in sexual needs..This early age most of them are un educated children..How pity to these children of my country..Abortion is against the law in Philippines..Shame on to these people who do abortion..
"Look, the west is trying to make us a degenerate society just like how radical feminist destroyed their society.<br><br>Stop child abuse and ban killing babies (abortion)."
We dont believe in contraception because we believe we can control ourself<br><br>Oh boi üòí

"Because of broken family. Family far from God &amp; lack of education. Because of corruption, most of liberal party &amp; oligarchs."
I thought they rightly changed the age of consent to 18?
Religious wickedness I call this.  Backwards and not in the intrest of the people and the country.  Poor childen who have to suffer  due to these idiots.
"For women who already have a baby and accepted by a man is so very lucky and grateful for women but a year after, a man would say to you that you should be thankful that i accept you even you have already baby, that kind of man is a bullshit.. What kind of mindset is that.. You accept the girl because you love her and you see your future in her not the other way round. You will say that in front of her  face not minding what she gone through to save herself from cruelty of  her surrounding. You&#39;re her partner, you accept her good side then you must accept her flaws, you must be her hero not the one who gonna drag her down.."
Majority of teenage pregnancies in the Philippines are poor
It is not the fault of God it is the fault of the priest and the church
"I&#39;m watching this 1 am, We still have online class tomorrow üíÄ <br><br>Now I&#39;m motivated to study hard for Our Country"
Age of consent is 12? Nope! You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s actually 18.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=5m45s"">5:45</a> He didn&#39;t know that the girl was only 14?<br><br>What the heck? LIAR!"
"Poor education will eventually destroy the country. The Department of Education is run by fools. The Catholic religion hampers efforts to control population growth. Of course, why limit the churches&#39; source of income?"
It is more sin and sad to be pregnant unplanned and cant take care the babies.
"I&#39;m Filipino and I live in the Philippines. The legal age is actually 18 not 12. And EVERYBODY here knows that (except for those ignorant or should I say pedophiles). 12 is just to protect tribal culture of the ancient Filipinos. Those people are so isolated from modern world but still their culture is protected by the government. And if you&#39;re not from that tribe and you f*cked a kid, (even if the kid is from the tribe) dude you&#39;re in a serious problem."
This makes me want to move to the Philippines and help these poor children

"I think women should be given not only options for contraception but also safe abortion.

Everybody ignores the fact Christian missionaries are funding this problem. Christianity is a plague.
"I&#39;m a Filipino and I feel very sad about this reality. Reading the comments, I agree that the problem in here is sexual abuse. It&#39;s just sad that most of the young women who get pregnant grow up in poverty, and when they became teenage moms, poverty continues. I don&#39;t know, this situation is really painful. It&#39;s just that they grow up deprived with good Education and lack of good opportunities. Despite this frustrating fact, I&#39;m Still hopeful that this curse will soon be broken. I really want to be part in changing this sad fate. I grow up in a financially unstable family and I totally understand the bitterness of poverty. I&#39;m a Filipino and I wanna be part of the change."

"Unfortunately, the government has no plans for them. They just use them during elections. They can&#39;t even force parents to send their children to school despite the existing laws on compulsory education. Programs were created but was not enforced. <br><br>Regarding the age of consent, they already filed a bill(increasing 12 to 16) but it is still pending. It seems that our law making body is busy with something else. We did sign a petition to make it urgent but politics would always be politics. Something that does not produce money would be the last priority. <br><br>I myself as a Filipino is very much against the age of consent as it gives legal pass of offenders."

"This is sad...most Filipino families can barely feed one child...they go and have half a dozen. When I came home for the first time after living abroad for so many years, my old neighbours scoffed when I told them I only have one child, and prefer it that way. They called me ‚Äòstingy‚Äô for not wanting more.."
This is insane.....how about castration for getting a child pregnant....that would be a fair penalty for these so called men who can&#39;t even support themselves to keep their hands off of children
Twelve?! I‚Äôm filipino and I‚Äôve never heard of THAT being the age of consent.
The government has made a plan to control this problem but the church is against contraceptives and since most of the Philippine population is Catholic they side with the church. Belief is beautiful but not when it gets in the way of anybody&#39;s life. (They believe the church so blindly that I&#39;ve had people tell me that they believe that the earth is flat and doesn&#39;t believe in science cause it doesn&#39;t say so in the bible) Religious Hypocrisy.
This is so sad. No wonder so many Filipino women are fed up with Filipino men and look for husbands from abroad.
A man wanting a baby is often about ego and a desire to pass on their line. They aren&#39;t tasked with being the primary caregiver.
These laws are all built to benefit men.

"Seeing the comments made me even more sad. These girls wouldnt know any better since this problem has always been here. If you are a Filipina with catholic friends, they would shame you for using comtraceptives. <br><br>Without this channel you guys wouldnt know how bad our government is."
"this is why i never liked and subscribed to this channel,  first of all you could have mentioned the place exactly where you were doing the exact interview- not generalizing the country as a whole. have you read the comments section? people look down on us because of people like you. the answer to all these comes from their own household, now you mentioned &quot;slum&quot; that does not mean the &quot;whole country&quot;, government and religion is a strong influence, but they do not condone this a 100% from my own experience i had to be 23+ to be even starting to date or having a bf. studies first before anything else. if you chose not to do that you will be disciplined &quot;hard&quot; and i&#39;m not talking about footwear slapping on the face alone. this is so biased- its like that white gay boy on facebook i had to tell off because he said &quot; philippino girls are yuck, basically you can see them everywhere with dirty old men and you cannot probably imagine what they do once they&#39;re alone, and i think that is the main reason i become gay too. because eew.&quot; like GTFO, i&#39;d like to see and hear how  a middle east based media is so pure and clean especially with women or their employees (house- based)or how do you refer them to? and religion? indians can switch religions, but what about you people?"
Lol üòÇ idiots in the comments are talking about church and religion when they don&#39;t even have the slightest idea about what it is.<br>These are the people who support baby killing in the Name of abortion. <br>You do realise that most if them are not by rape?

"Here&#39;s  my suggestion  to all under aged pregnant  girls who ended up that way due to lack of contraception,  education  or pressure....GIVE BIRTH AND LEAVE  ALL YOUR BABIES AT THE DOOR OF ANY CATHOLIC CHURCH! It&#39;s so easy for that sect to be so self righteous when their priests and nuns are not burdened with the obligation to raise children they can&#39;t afford."
"A good friend of my wife had an (of course illegal) abortion there many years ago. Something went wrong, and she can&#39;t become pregnant anymore since. She married nevertheless (a former student of hers, both are almost the same age) and have two big dogs they call their children and who can sleep in their bed. Unusual for the Philippines, but they are great people and the two dogs are lovely. Apart from that contraceptives are freely available since the RHB-bill was approved during the Nonoy-presidency. And to be honest: A little more chastity won&#39;t be bad. I didn&#39;t have my first sexual contact until I was almost 27 and my wife until we married, and she was 36 at that time. And we are both not radical conservative zealots. Boy-friend is fine, but why do you have to jump with him into the next available bed at first chance? I know a couple of cases in our neighborhood and even advanced family where we really asked ourselves why those involved were that stupid? In one case the young son of a house-helper impregnated three girls in three years. And his mother went mad of anger (not literally) with him. But in most cases this is a problem of school-dropouts. And times have changed even in the Philippines. When one is really so naive that he/she doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, there are family-planning-bureaus in the barangays who give advice without asking for your name."

What seems to be the most asanine thing is that the countries where these religions have formed and had strongholds are now filled with atheists and strict church and state separation laws. My mom used to say people who are recently converted to a religion are always the most extremely religious ones because they think they have to prove their piety. Sad these girls and women are suffering.

It‚Äôs really sad"
"12 is not the age of consent in the Philippines. These guys focused on the slums in the Philippines, it might be the right age for that place but not in the whole Philippines. Smh."
How many of these white female journalists send money to help these families. At the end of the day it comes down to how many of us are willing to put our money where are mouths are and send aid
Philippines is a Catholic Country.  Catholic Priests Love Children.<br><br>Especially Boys between ages 8 -14
"Not abortion,education"
Fbi is rather needed than god here
Philippine is a sick country !
"People blame this on religion, but Italy and Spain were catholics when contraceptions were not widely available and did not face these problems. I&#39;m not religious but any christian religion from what I know argues for abstinence before marriage. The cases presented definitely do not subscribe to that. It looks to be a social and cultural problem. You could &#39;sell&#39; contraceptives to those poor girls but they would not afford them. Education, peer pressure and abstinence are potential solutions. Do those fathers pay child support? People need to be made responsible not given a quick way out of their bad decisions."
I now understand why there are a lot of Filipinos in the gulf region being mistreated
"so , you don&#39;t want contraceptive  because they should wait until marraige. Suposse that they wait, then get married and then what? pop as many kids as God gives to them? I&#39;m catholic but the logic of this extremist groups makes me sick!!!"
"Guys this isn&#39;t a joke, I confirmed $30,000 from premiumtoolsaid,com, they are legit"
The catholic church is basically causing the problem and the same in Africa.
I‚Äôm tempted to ran for public responsibility in my community focusing youth program and I wish I have my own money to fund it üò≠
Lack of government intervention politician don‚Äôt care once they get elected this problem is at the bottom of their priority that‚Äôs the problem
The girl in thumbnail looks like predebut Blackpink Lisa. No joke
The problem is sexual abuse wtf. We need reform amputangina nanggigigil ako
"No/Poor guidance from the parents, lack of education.  Most families in the Philippines live in the slums have many children. Whatever the kids see in their parents or surroundings may reflect on them. The generation continues."
I can&#39;t believe this. At that time I thought it&#39;s bad in South Africa I am really fortunate to to in this country. We are liberated and informed.
This is how much I hate seeing underage gets pregnant.<br>‚§µÔ∏è
Teen pregnancy and teen drugs addicted in Philippines <br>I was in Manila Philippines 12 years some girls do heroin
i live in the philippines and i always thought that  women&#39;s right here is protected (being the most gender neutral country in asia) clearly i was wrong. this is so sad and disgusting
Really 12 is the age of consent in the philippines??? It&#39;s my first time to hear this. I thought its 18 same with legal age.
The government must and should put all the girls in boarding schools. Why can&#39;t the people who took the vedios ask the govrnment
"We had a sliver of hope with the passage of the Reproductive Health Act, but critical provisions of the law was held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Lawmakers care more of their &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;morals&quot; than these girls."

Deeply sad :(
"This country among others, is in dire need of serious reform and guidance. The level of sheer ignorance from that governor was just unbelievable."
Education is a must in this country
"Ayan Pilipinas, Pinoy? bakit di priority ang adukasyon?  Damihan pa ang anak, at malugmok nlang sa habangbuhay na kahirapan.."
"Nothing unhealthy about having a baby at 18, what&#39;s unhealthy is having a baby at 40!"
This definitely got my blood boiling....... 12 year old they are still children sigh this is crazy....
the sad thing is there&#39;s really no media coverage about this. people need to be aware. the thing about our government is that they won&#39;t do anything unless there&#39;s an outrage from the people. it&#39;s so fking sad.
I am soooooooo angry üò§
Amazing!
Religion is bad a relationship with Jesus Christ is good.
This is pedophilia
12!!!! This is crazy
One less mouth to feed! When I hear that phrase it physically makes me sick to the core. Here in Newfoundland we will literally take it off our plates to see someone else eat.Its crazy how different and hard  it is in certain parts of the world .üò†

5 minutes into this and it&#39;s disgusting! 12 is way to young! Taking advantage of these children.
"I‚Äôm from Philippines, I am really lucky because i am studying, eat 3 times a day and i can buy i want because of my parent , I‚Äôm very thankful to my parent"
These peeps are STUPID!!!!!!!!!
Kathryn bernardo look alike c maymay
Honestly these girls will struggle having 5+ kids they will struggle to provide ... i would tell my daughter this
"All I see is exploitation, ignorance, coercion and kids being taken advantage of. This is depressing."
"I don&#39;t see those catholic churches pay for little moms raising their babies and children. Where&#39;s god when they need him morally,  practically,  logically , even physically???"
"It&#39;s hard for poor Filipinos to be¬†highly¬†educated as high school?  <br>I mean, education¬†is NOT¬†free¬†to¬†students in Phillipinese?<br>I think Filipino Government¬†must¬†intervene the education system for them."
Christian society...
What kind of miserable life is this???
"When God is not given a rightful place and kingship in every home, it has great negative implications in the society. Degeneration and moral decay abounds. It is very sad and disheartening to see the decline, loss and decay of morality in my own country. The innocence, purity and chastity of the minors are all thrown into the gutter to be feasted on by the dogs! Whoever must have passed that law that the age of consent is 12 years old, must be mentally unsound and have sold his soul to Satan because it is absolutely not right and totally demonic! I totally agree with Vice Gov. Dennis Socrates. Who and what is UN - it is NOT God; it is only run by just mere people (who maybe some are godless and unbelievers at all). At the end of our life, it is personally and spiritually NOT between United Nations and us BUT God and us."
"Governments must invest on sexual education to teach children that they deserve to enjoy their childhood, etc. Before having babies."
My heart aches for those girls. 12 is the age of my kids at summer camp not being assaulted by a culture that encourages it. This is a rape of a nation of girls and no one does anything for them
the fact that that lady said that the problem is not only young girls giving birth but the economy not being able to benefit off of them disgusts me
<b>i still love watching this kind of video than cartoons ^_^</b>
"ang masasabi ko lang ay tangina nanggigil ako sa mga batang yan. di man lang inisip future nila. alam ko di nila gusto yung nangyari pero bakit hindi nila kinasuhan, sila na nga yung masisira ang buhay pinairal pa yung kalandian. tsk, tsk"

"13 year-olds getting pregnant by 22-year olds is uncommon.  Nice propaganda from Qatar, where women must wear trashbags over their heads in public and cannot drive or vote."
ARGH the government loses money the government don&#39;t do enough to help the poor so don&#39;t go talking about the government losing money when it&#39;s the governments fault the people live in slums.
wala lang gusto ko lang mag rant yawa wag ko lang kayo makita kita dito iitakin ko kayo chaaaarrr .. bente uno tamang duyan duyan lang bawal lumabas hakhakhak
"Correction please, the legal age or age of consent in the Philippines is 18, not 12. Children below 18 are considered minors. Please get your facts straight."
I felt sick when the woman explained how she performed the abortions. These women deserve better.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=12m28s"">12:28</a> &quot;and having no access to contraception can have tragic consequences&quot; *shows a clip of flies mating. LMAO"
The title itself &quot;The baby factory&quot;  is absurd. Please don&#39;t generalize through this situation on this documentary about our country. I think some of the people who make their comments was just based by watching this not so pleasing documentary of Aljazzera. Please roam around our country not only to depressed area such as featured here for you to see the beauty of the people and places.
actually Duterte suggested a three child policy since most of the stupid politician don&#39;t like 2..but yep still denied.. pathetic country.. i feel like even they make a 10 child policy they will still not allowing it.. poor education system makes this country worse
The lady who practice abortions pray at the altar before aborted a baby??? WTF
feel bad for these young girls and to their kids.......this is one of the reasons why my mom always reminds me  not going to places like bars to avoid such negative results.....
48....no
Still won&#39;t date no single mother&#39;s lol üòÇü§£
"When I was in Philippines, the unusual high number of children shocked me, and I guessed it was mostly because of the Catholic church. I also guessed Philippines must be hotbed for foreign peodophiles, but I really didn&#39;t imagine the problem was much more bigger. Truly horrific..."
S lahat nlng ng kalokohN sikat ang pinoy
This is a sexual abuse issue. Consent is at 12 years! That‚Äôs a child. Why are these older men preying on young girls. Laws need to be changed.
Gandang bataüò¢
"You cant force people to have babies and not offer contraception and expect teen pregnancies to go down, sorry"
they should teach those teens that condoms are much cheaper than raising a child.
Contraceptive must be used  whether you like it or not catholic community doesn‚Äôt help you god help you but you need to think the future of your kids to make there life better
All my body is shaking and shuddering ! This is so cruel
Oh My God !!!!!
The Catholic church is the problem in third countries as it wants to control every aspect of society by blocking laws. Religion and politics are a dangerous mix of poison that can kill any one who are against their draconian and medieval thinking.
"Such a sad state of affairs, and religious dogma is a lot to blame."
I live in the Philippines and I am actually saying to myself<br><br><br>&quot;ANONG KAPUTANGINAHAN ITO?!&quot;<br><br><br>WHAT KIND OF BULLSHITTERY IS THIS?!
How many of those ultra-conservatives visit the 12-year-old girls in those slums to rape them?
They should work on their language usage...<br><br>These biodonors are rapists and pedophiles.
I&#39;m moving there to marry my fiance. My heart is bleeding already. I&#39;m a giver. I can&#39;t see myself walking past these poor children without offering some kind of help or offering. How can people be so cruel and yet so precious at same time..

There are literally no words to define how outraged I am that this even happens.
I believe filipinos have been trick by the europeans and exloited. They want to see them suffer. The catholics have it all wrong.
One of the many reasons I wish to adopt girls from here....So they can have an actual future
"Goodness gracious ! So the church does not belive in contraceptives, no abortion, legal consent dropped to 12 so to normalize this ???  How crazy is this mess."
"I‚Äôm really feel very sorry for these  young girls, they look so innocent. Poverty  is the biggest problem and lack of education. Hope there government will help them, and recover them from this kind of situation"
"Please don&#39;t abort, is killing human! Is a big sin!The embrion whit 3monts have everything, hands, HEART, brain, they cut him in pieces whit a scissors instrument and suck it off! HE is scare and thry to escape the scissors! WHEN I SAW THE FILM OF ABORTION I WAS SHOCKED! GOOGLE IT TO SEE! Lord bless you all!"
Ik the second is gross for sleeping with a 14 year old but at least his still there taking care of his responsibilities .... some men just leave these poor girls
My oh my xüíîüíî
The Catholics want babies for their pedophile ring this is why they say it&#39;s bad too educate and allow prevention
"I know this is a very old video that the moment is gone and my opinion doesn‚Äôt really matter before but i REALLY need to share this.<br><br>As a filipino, the Religious side of the Philippines has caused more problems than solving them(I don‚Äôt even think they solve any).<br>Religion has always been a hindrance in the growth of the Philippines. People here tend to listen to someone no matter how corrupt or selfish he/she is by just saying the word ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or ‚ÄúLord‚Äù in everything they say. Good Morale was already dead in this country when you mix religion with it. Religion was nothing but a lie, it becomes a ‚Äúshield‚Äù to anyone that did something wrong, it becomes a ‚Äúweapon‚Äù that can be used to destroy something that they considered as ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. Punishments tends to become ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in this country and people that deserve punishment are still walking freely because ‚ÄúPUNISHING SOMEONE WHO DID WRONG IS WRONG BECAUSE PUNISHING IS WRONG‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even know why they have jails here, bad people still freely walks all around.<br><br>But what do i know right? Im 14 so my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter<br>I just said what i couldn‚Äôt say in here"

"In the more advanced USA, they legally slice baby penises and take the skin off. And then hold a celebration. In Israel too."
"Over throw Catholic. If priests are not abusing girls, they should have advised to raise the age. Better to have Protestants just like a woman helping girls were evangelical christian."
"Here go the catholic church again, ruining childrens lives. Nothing changes, scumbags"

"Wow, that&#39;s heartbreaking. I haven&#39;t been that moved in a while."

"Imagine in today&#39;s modern times, protection for women and children against abuse of all kinds so that people are afforded a childhood and opportunity to become someone...."
Got very teary watching this stuff. How in this world does any sensible person decide that a 12 year old girl is ready to be a wife and a mother? Absolutely Pathetic.
The Catholic church is evil and controlling
That little baby puppy needs to be fed!
The best way in explaning this to young people is by telling them that if girl gets pregnant and the guy becomes a young father their future will be ruined...they cannot continue with thier studies and they will consume time spending taking care of their child...&quot;THAT SHOULD BE THE EXPLAINATION&quot;... deep explaination will not help
Such A sad story it&#39;s children having children and the so called men more like monsters that sleep with these young girls should be punished it&#39;s absolutely disgusting
omg this really breaks my heart. im in pain
You can&#39;t blame the government for everything....there is something we call parenting...they need to talk with the child or children....if they are feeling awkward then nothing will change. If you can&#39;t raise and educate a child then don&#39;t make children or have s*x..because they will only suffer at the end they are themselves a child who can&#39;t take her own care and on top of that they live in poverty.
its every where around the world...not only in philippines.
Omg. So dirty this place.
this is crazy 100000graduate
Philippines wake up guys!  Sana makita yu nang mga taong makaktulong sa iba.
"And this is why so many poor countries remain poor. The poor keep having children at young ages because of lack of education and it keeps them in that cycle of poverty. And then you have asshats like that governor who believe all life is sacred regardless of circumstances, who choose to turn a blind eye at reality and the logistics of the the situation."
This is not normally!!!! Thats exactly why religion is extremely dangerous... People are just ignorant and stupid. Nobody is doing anything about this situation and continue to destroy young lives. I would slaps these mens who think they can do what ever they want to. Totally disgusting and stupid
Now we understand a little more the reason for such Poverty in Philippines.
12?? WTF?
Leave the Philippines alone in solving its own problem!!!! You sick people look in your own filthy backyards first before you looked at others. You are a bunch of hypocrites!!!
"I can barely find the words to convey how I feel after watching this. It&#39;s heartbreaking seeing what these CHILDREN are going through. I feel like lobbying of the government is a much needed act to help deal with this issue. a 12 year old is barely able to deal with their own body not to speak of growing a baby and giving birth. The vicious cycle here is not good for anyone, I wish that more people would realize this."
It happens only in squaters area....poor family have many children...rich family  1 or 2 only.thats why poor becomes poorest ang rich becomes richer...
√í
there‚Äôs so many wrongs in this whew
Honestly I don‚Äôt think Education would help them since the church is the one making it so immoral to regulate their family.
"Evidently, in Filipino culture all responsibility and blame for unwanted pregnancies are dumped  on girls‚Äô shoulders. What about those grown-@ss males constantly prowling on females - especially the younger ones - misleading them to surrender their bodies and/or sexually assaulting them? The government AND the church should combine efforts to educate men to be responsible and make them accountable for their actions. All family members should be educated, too."
Give them all cell phones with plenty of games.  They will enjoy them more than making babies.
As what catriona said &quot; lack of child support not poverty that killed their dreams&quot;
23 yo have 4 children? I&#39;m 29 years old and had no one of child! It&#39;s not fair üò≠
Bring all those children to the catholic church... let them feed them and give those kids a good future.
Philipine..back to islam..you will be save and peace
Those poor girls
Soon The whites N yellow become ext
Good for future economic think of market!!!
12 is the legal limit and tourist are aware of this fact also. Its a cesspool for pedophilia and those poor girls can&#39;t do anything about it. They are exploited because they are so poor. This angers me to no end !! There is no protection for them. ü§¨üò§
"There should be some type of program for those absent fathers and an accountability consequence for their actions. If they can get someone pregnant without some kind of penalty, in their minds it&#39;s no big deal.There should be something that will make them think before they get someone pregnant and leave."
filipinos want unlimited babies. just like unlimited txt‚ò∫
The church cares more about money..
If u ask me that&#39;s just another way to keep the poor poor
Catholic never was the church of God BC they were so evil in there regime they teach falsely  doctrines that were <b>contraceptive</b> they dominate in many country though people are still unconscious just sad.
"Its not always those young girls faults, some parents just dont know how to raise well their kids too."
This is hard to watch. When outsiders influences your country. This is were American like to travel.
The evil that lurks in the heart of men.
That‚Äôs great you expose the people and place that they can get the meds for an abortion for the sake of a news story.
"Wtf, 12? Are we living in the dark ages? Fukn invade the Philippines."
This man looks hella old...like about 40. Arrest him.
If the United Nations wants to help people they should find ways to one help countries produce food but help guide people to use birth control
I‚Äôd rather a young girl use contraception than die of an abortion gone wrong.
"I lived in the Philippines for almost 10 years, and the legal age is 18.  This 12 years thing, is a load of bollocks. I asked my Filapina wife about it, and she had never heard of it."
"The social welfare officer is not active.....there is enough fund for someone like her programs and counselling, education too......."
He says he‚Äôs 28 .....hmmmm I‚Äôm 17 then.
"Oh i got it, just another stupid video against pro life movement. Huh"
This is unbelievable...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=0m22s"">0:22</a> At a legal age of 12&amp;15 consents? What kind a .FK. Parents and country? Its so so wrong. No moral or a real heart."
"This is a fact video of living in poverty. Parents are basically absent. There are no easy answers, or villains to blame."
"That Vice Governer, Is Very Correct, IM Surprised to hear this, of an Philipino! The Government should be held responsible to fund proper social relations, but is of their social families, responsibilities! Notice how its Justified for Women creating a &#39;Baby Businues&#39; out of her lifestyle; for &#39;Her&#39; continual financial support!"
But Notice how its Justified for Women creating a Baby Businues for her continual financial support!
Shouldn‚Äôt you set getting contraceptives and consent at the same year? 12 and 18 seem a bit um....
Los filipinos son maravillosos
"Thats why our President now, Rodrigo Duterte is so against this bishops. Catholic Churches is corrupt."
The church sounds so brain washing with the no  contraception and I think the root of the problem is the sexual assault problem so many have said they were forced or groomed into it this is disgusting the men forcing them self‚Äôs into the young girls
What is wrong with the authority and government.
The result of early boyfriend and  lazy to go to school.
"To avoid like that, you should go to school first, and dont enter a relationship  early."
Yan kasi ang babata pa ay nag bo boyfriend na... D pa nga nila alam kung gaano ka hirap ang buhay boyfriend na kc ang inatupag.. Tapos duon ma realize pag huli na

This breaks my heart
Misleading when the reporter said that age of consent is 12 in the Philippines. It should be 18 years old. That is the majority age or legal age. Even if with consent so long as he or she is a minor(below 18 years old) then that is rape.
12 for age of consent? Im a Filipino and I didn&#39;t know that till nowüòÇ Im 17 and my parents still barely consents me to sleepovers and Im a guy!üòÇ

"It&#39;s pretty sad that the most intelligent thing someone said was the teen boy pushing for contraception. He knows teenagers are stupid and make mistakes and knows when you&#39;re already in a poor situation,  a baby can only worsen it, especially in third world countries"
consent at the age of 12?!?

Where is her parents then??
Don&#39;t you just love religion.  Always making the problems of the world 10 times worse.
"Thats false. The legal age here in the Philippines is 18. Those involved with sexual intercourse with a minor is already statutory rape. Women and children have equal rights here in our country, we had seminars regarding the VAWC law,( violence against women and children) and the government gave monthly allowances to children who&#39;re enrolled to encourage them to go to school and have an education, we even have out of school youth programs etc. The Philippines now is beginning to change and more and more people are now aware and more brave to voice out and have a stand.  But there are still parents who ignore these services and chose to live that way. This is not a cultural or religion thing. This is poverty and ignorance. But despite all these hardships, the country wont stop in thinking of ways to help our fellow men and women."
Sick<br>I bet if they stopped the children having children then there would not be as many poor peopl
The big problem I think is the gap between the rich and the poor in the Philippines. There is no middle class and the world the rich grow up in is so much different than the world in this poor village.
"Baby Factory ? It sounds a bit goofy but hides the harsh reality : Poverty, lack of education and healthcare, a religious presence that does little and a patriarchal mindset and a lack of political will. An accurate though crude, cruel and appropriate name would be : The Insect factory . At least it describes the apathy that a government and people have for the species. 12 as an age of consent? Ridiculous does not even begin to describe it!"

"Stupid so called expert at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a> talks about how these girls won&#39;t be able to enter the economy/job market since they can&#39;t go to school because they are having babies. There is no viable economy or job market for them even if they graduate from high school. Look at the squalor they live in. Giving them a diploma isn&#39;t going to suddenly create a job for them. You need to create an economy that provides jobs with a livable wage. THEN you can address the other issues."

Oh boy if it was a Muslim country the commentary would have been different lol
This is so scary :( Why the country doesn&#39;t take precautions to prevent this? These girls&#39; lives are getting destroyed by such prematured pregnancy!! It&#39;s pretty worst scenario there. Bangldesh also had same problem but it&#39;s developing here. People are getting more aware about young girls&#39; safety and higher education.
More paedophilia than partnership. The parents r useless as well for consenting it to happen. I‚Äôm Catholic but I‚Äôm all for contraceptive measures . And it should b the women‚Äôs choice and decision to what she wants to do with her body.

If she wants an abortion dont forcefully stop her. Shes a dam child  with a life ahead of her and no real love partner. If that child ur fighting so hard to bring his/her birth about is going to suffer cruelly with hunger and poverty, no education, a mother who will never really be able to love and care for her unwanted baby; is that not a fate worse than death? Furthermore if u are pro life, then fight for the childs dam life. That baby girls birth means nothing if her life means suffering a pregnancy at 14 and dropping outta school and working until shes nearly dead from exhaustion for her kid cuz her boyfriend left. So please. Fight for her life. Not her birth. Her life"

This should be stop. The government needs to know about it make and a move right now. This affects the country. The barangay should visit houses to check and educate them.

Yes indeed the man-hating feminist have been let loose in this one. But if you think the Philippines is bad just take a visit to India and check out their government hospitals absolutely appalling. I&#39;m sorry but this age of consent exist mostly in the very poorest of areas where I live in the Philippines I don&#39;t see twelve-year-olds pregnant or giving birththis super young birthing seems to be something that happens among the poorest and the most uneducated. But of course the feminist man haters will all cry out toxic masculinity
"The age of consent is 12, but they&#39;re not allowed to get contraceptives on their own until 18??? Makes literally no sense..."
I thinks its a problem of education as well

That abortion lady I wonder how many kids dies from her bleeding out. just for the money cruel sad world

The Vice Governor is an idiot!  OMG Blind to what is happening to his country.  No vision for the future.
The Filipino govt. needs to raise the age of consent and limit couples to 1 child per couple much like China used to do.  Change the thinking.  OMG
"I think and I believe the best way to prevent this is to build a stronger foundation of a person&#39;s religious views. Just like in my Born Again church, we believe in a much greater power which is God Himself and with Him, we shouldnt associate ourselves with such acts or if we already had associated before, we should stop it and repent for the sins we had committed. I do not attack certain religious organization here, but as a converted Christian, I believe that the best way is to raise your child in a God-fearing environment and to love the Father wholeheartedly that he or she might not do something that will result into a sin. Again, I just wanted to help and that is my view."
"A country with... <br>-no divorce law.

The unnecessary burdens imposed by religion and the consequences of it.
"It&#39;s actually dillematic about such poor girl condition. They can press charge to the man who impregnated them by the law. But, they just don&#39;t do it. Since their daily life is depending on those men who feed them and give money for daily life. If the man put in jail, they should find money on their own. Problem is they are less educated. Finding proper job will be really difficult. That even whit another burden of who will take care the kids"

"But if we condemn artificial chemicals in our food, why do we think contraceptives are good for these girls?"
Snip snip snip
Wow religion really makes people blind and ignorant.
The age for consent should be change to at least 16 and parents should have no right in making decisions on if to file charges or not because their own interest is who takes the girls out of their hands.
Then why they need producde such as huge baby community..
"lots of the comments are funny but guys, we have to take this seriously and know that this is a true problem. we have to be thankful that we don&#39;t have to get pregnant at 12, and that we can still watch Spongebob or something at 12, and we should be grateful for our lives. You see how poor they are and how lucky we can be.<br>So take a moment and be thankful that we don&#39;t live through that."

"Well, where I was born girls HAD TO go through sexual education classes, BEFORE they menstruate. The education came from the last year medical students( ladies). They have to do it for free of charge as a social education class . Win, win, win situation. In my classes NO GIRL got pregnant , ALL of them finished their education , and all of them received a profession. Any question ?"
This is so ridiculous!! Preventing pregnancy is a sin but letting the child to live in poverty way the rest of his life is not sin?? People need to educate themselves rather than listen to church and religion ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The Catholic Church does not care if people are impoverished as long as they keep producing more Catholics to further increase the Church&#39;s power and influence.

Yo Steve hit me up wid a DM
"wait, her boyfriend met someone else and took their children with him?"
Surely a pedophiles paradise.
Sad
Thats why it us prohibited by god to be in such relationships before proper  marriage. The parents have to teach their children whats right and what is wrong dont allow your daughter&#39;s at such age to have grown up boyfriends.
Messed up culture with crappy laws
World its crazy!!!!
12!!! This is child rape!<br>This should NEVER be ok in any culture. <br>Poor little girls
They need a better education and laws preventing these girls from being sexualized. Laws that would criminalize predators. Contraceptives will not help these young girls from being assaulted rather it would mask their troubles only.
Thank you Catholic Church for the unwanted pregnancies you caused in the name of banning abortions.
"Poor girls even if you have your consent you shouldn&#39;t have kids in 12 or 14 years of age. These guys are literally pedo in my society, its like child marriages in our culture which are now banned."
he is blaming her for losing  a baby but it was his fault to sexually assault her and GOT HER PREGNANT. and she didn&#39;t know she was pregnant. she clearly didn&#39;t know the consequences. she got hurt and she shouldn&#39;t  be experiencing this at such a young age
Que tristeza esta Est√° vida como la hisieron puro sufrimiento
This is giving me an overall look into how women and young girls are being treated all over the world. We are being subjugated by using all forms known to mankind. I&#39;m literally sick. Their being taken advantage of and these babies are coming into the world not knowing what&#39;s going on.
"Hold up.... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=5m55s"">5:55</a>- He says they had been together a year, and claims he didn‚Äôt know she was 14...suspicious and disgusting"
This is so sad! I can&#39;t believe all of these countries that allow child molestation it is disgusting and makes my hear heart.
Gross
Where did you get that info of the age of consent is 12?
Catholic Church is just causing the same problems as any other religion. It prevents development and logical thinking. Ban them from institutions like school. Thank you!
Ay aj+ is doing something right
"Ironic that a news station, funded by and promoting the ideals of the Islamic Brotherhood, is making shows about child abuse and the exploitation of females."
Most of family planning were always blamed at lady&#39;s when in fact it should be both. Men should have vasectomy when he has atleast 4 children. And all boy&#39;s should put in jail when they neglected their child. Not to force a young lady to use contraceptive.
HOLLY MOTHER OF GOD! THIS IS SAD AND HEART BREAKING!
Those type of men‚Äôs are worse than pigs...Poor girls

"Breeding like rabbits making babies is the main cause for poverty in the Philippines. They have no regards for the innocent kids suffering...... People who can&#39;t feed, cloth, put a roof over their child and sending them to school should have no business making babies. Hundreds or even thousands of children begging in the streets of Philippines daily seems normal to the Filipinos. The Philippines refuses to wake up and just ignores it.... So who&#39;s to blame for the high rate of poverty? Answer is very obvious. The Filipinos.  Making babies in the PI seems like a hobby.....Just totally sad."
No parents here in the Philippines would give their consent to their minor child. You one sided reporters.
Poor Philippine&#39;s im sad for my countryüò•üò∞üò¢
"WTF!!! When I was 10, all I think of is just playing games and hangout with my friends. This is just messed up."
Why they wanted children if they can&#39;t afford them? This is highly irresponsible
"I am from the Philippines. It&#39;s horrible, because a lot of times girls get raped by relatives."
the girls eyebRows makes me uncomfortable
A lot of people still uses religion as slavery and to further  their agenda. These girls are babies for God&#39;s sake. That man is a liar saying he didn&#39;t  know her age. This is so twisted. They should bebin school getting an education. Sick!
"I am a Catholic and have met many Catholics and been to churches and such and even my priest knows if you were God forbid assaulted you should get the choice to let the fetus grow or not. My church always let us know we are in charge of our bodies and God will forgive us for whatever decision we choose. I am not sure why most people try to input religion to whatever viewpoint they want. This is wrong, and should not be acceptable."
The more I hear about Philippines..the less I want to visit....single moms 68 percent.  Don&#39;t go there to seek a future marriage partner. üëé
"As a pastor, I have to say that the live pure program is garbage.  Gender identity and sexual identity is not that simple.  That was moronic to say the least. It says something when the guy singing songs to look cool ignores the teenagers getting pregnant by rape and says yiu can keep it in ur pants like that is these youths&#39; fault.  This is just brainwashing and totally irresponcible of the Catholic church.  Statistics say that all the things the church claims they are against like premarital pregnancy, divorce etc happens at exactly the same percentage in the church as it does outside of it. What religion teaches is that we are all the same.  We all have the capacity to much good and much harm.  That is the human condition. The hope we claim is that we are all able to be good bc we are created good.  This is such a sad story..."
"Its all our fault,,we make them look so pitiable,,but they are all in ,,illiterate foools,,so stop piitying this lusty girl,,they know what they are doing,,and let them  suffer,,to understand for better..."
No proud  to be filipino  comments here??  Or not proud when it comes to truth
This kind of case because of  &quot;PLEASURE&quot; of both partners without gaining information and knowledge. At the end the children inherited suffering and just what parents do is feel &#39;PITY&quot; and the worse scenario biological parents will just leave them.<br><br><br>Anyway at the end they will pay the price

"I am seriously sad. Didn&#39;t know this.  I am dating a Filipino, and I truly want to marry her.  She deserves a good life. They all do."
The laws contradict each other
That doesn&#39;t make sense. Age of consent 12 but have to get consent to use contraceptives
Now I understand why low life men go to the Philippines
The major media channels love making developing countries look very bad with stories like these. Especially white/western media. Do not trust these white people.
&quot;...because they feed me well...&quot;. We have degraded ourself down to the level of animals :(
Abortion is illegal in the Philippines because we are a Christian Country but I feel sorry for those rape victims. Abortion is only legal in case of medical problems wherein the mother&#39;s life is at risk if she gets pregnant.
Vasectomy should be performed on these men
Bullsht catholic church .they keep contradicting the rh bill.but they have no action to teenage pregnancy to there members
When I&#39;m 17 I give birth my baby and it&#39;s hard to carry the baby coz is my first time   but I realize that being a young mom is very2x hard  but now I&#39;m a 19 of age and I&#39;m from Phillipines to... And I&#39;m proud being a single mom
"Literally breeding poverty, so sad."
Philippines unable to handle or incapable of handling its own problems of uncontrolled population growth... international communities and organization should help because the problem might become international.. illegal filipinos are showing up in the shores of Thailand and Malaysia and  these countries also have their own problems
I&#39;m 17 and I don&#39;t even got a first boyfriend yet

"so,there ain&#39;t no schools ? what kind of education do they get?"
And they boast that they are well educated?  More educated than the USA they say.  Idiots.
Age of consent 12??? No wonder there is so much poverty there
"My mother used to tell my brother, ‚Äú if you can‚Äôt support it, keep it in your pants.‚Äù"
"i feel so sorry for the girl, the miscarriage was definitely not her fault!"
age of consent is 12... &quot;omg there are so many teenage pregnancies how do we solve this?????&quot; who dfuc is running this country...
Good lord this place needs immediate help....what government would say 12yrs old is consensual
Whereever these colonial power invaded ..they bring cursed and doomed life to locals ..  ...
OMG that is so so BAD ü§¢üòØü§îü§îü§îüôè
I am Christian not Catholic if they really care about not aborting them they most focus about child pregnancy because pedofilia is a huge sin in the bibble like incest.<br>I am biased against Catholic because of all the bad things they do but it seems they don&#39;t have their priority set right.<br>Look at how poor they are we all know how rich are Catholic church why not give money to why need it? <br>The church is the people not the building
They all want to be mothers at a young age sexual education and birth control if they don‚Äôt act it‚Äôs going to be a much bigger problem.
Disgusting!
Gross!
"12 is never been the legal age of consent in the Philippines, its 18."
I can feel pain in her eyes..My Rab what heppen in this worldüò¢
Use condoms ahhhhhhhhhh
They are all living in the slums!!! There is no formal economy!!!!
Whyyyy aren&#39;t they raising the age of consent????
"Hey it&#39;s their culture, STOP putting your Western values on it."
These people disgust me
well the laws can change but the actions of the teens won&#39;t

Remember Allah is just too stupid to know whether or not He is creating an infidel soul.<br>Islam kills infidels -- they practice they are smarter than Allah.<br><br>Who punishes Islam for insulting Allah&#39;s intelligence and eithic?
Like most third world countries there are a lot of uneducated poor people. The children of these people grow up on the street and have little moral guidance. The government cannot afford much social programs to help the poor and doesn&#39;t seem to concerned. Of course education is the key but the cost of education in Philippines is prohibitive and only the fortunate few can afford it!!!! The Catholic church with all it&#39;s outdated dogma does little to help the poor in Philippines!!!!
This isn‚Äôt the reality and interpretation is wrong why this pregnancy become a issue.? Because of age not a other things this is SEXUAL ABUSE need some legal assistance and protection
so many child rapist.what is the govt in phillipines doing.
Please issue a new order. Shoot to kill all the guys making anyone above 18 pregnant.
üò• üòÆüò• üòÆ¬†the government needs to take all the blames on these matters.
"Really? It&#39;s a &quot;big problem for the country&quot;?? 1st of all) what about the poor children who are being forced to have babies? 2nd if all) if your so worried about how the country will look, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. What did you expect when the age of consent is that of a pre-teen? This is a sexual assault problem, not a teen pregnancy problem. These aren&#39;t teens fooling around and they accidentally get pregnant. These are grown men preying on young girls who have to suffer the consequences, whatever they may be."
Que triste de verdad que pena lo que puede hacer la religi√≥n y la falta de educaci√≥n. Tantas vidas de j√≥venes son perjudicadas por ideas tan perjudiciales al futuro de estos j√≥venes. Antes de amar a Dios debes amarte a ti mismo y parte de amarte a ti mismo es cuidarte. Si no somos capaces de abstenernos pues hay que ser realistas y no querer tapar el sol con un dedo!  Use su preservativo para proteger su futuro y su vida que Dios le ha regalado! Est√© teniendo o no relaciones use sus preservativos porque cualquiera puede pecar y caer en la tentaci√≥n aunque no sea su intenci√≥n pero es mejor prevenir que lamentar.
Raise the adualt age to 18 yrs!  Give them work skills programs n goals!
What is wrong with her eyebrows....
"I‚Äôm a 12 yo and it‚Äôs horrific thinking about other 12 yo getting pregnant like imagine your whole childhood gone, you‚Äôll be physically an adult.. and the horrific men all look like drug addicts that all want one thing"
This is so sad. üò©ü§¶ But thank you for exposing this truth about our country. The first part in resolving a problem is to accept that the problem exists.
Why the age of consent Is so low? Why these girls need permission of their guardians to get contraceptives?? I think they need contraceptives more than anything else and no need for permission

Im from Philippines and haven&#39;t witness it.. might in a poor areas where kids are sucked in watching tele-drama these children are too young to discern the reality of life and its so SAAAAD as a fellow country men.
i hate this kind of news .
Don‚Äôt forget western countries especially USA is in TOP incest list
Chinese gata
The men are preys
What dumb stupid foolish laws
12.....12 12 Twelve????
What was done to help those young victims?
even in America they have that.

"This is real life, around the world, gtfo with the western judgement"
Wow I&#39;m Pilipina get married at 19 but get pregnant at the age of 21. I think I&#39;m just lucky that my husband respect me so much and told me that I&#39;m still young and need to enjoy life first before having baby. Life is struggle in Philippines but I learned a lot I start working at the age of 8 . Push myself to finish high school. And I did it. I want to go college but my parents don&#39;t want cuz we can&#39;t afford but God is good my husband send me in college and got my Bachelor Degree.
"The Prophet Muhammad had a 9 year old wife. The west does not dictate how the rest of the world lives. Their country, laws and culture."
It&#39;s really annoying like these people don&#39;t know any better not to have kids..
This a social-economic disease.  Countries with  a low education levels and lack of economic opportunities  are factors for teens pregnancy. But also now teens are more prone to satisfy they sexual urges without considering risk and consequences.
This is so emotional to watch
How tragic these older men are preying on such young kids.
Mei Mei is kinda pretty

So much bad things in this world! I&#39;m so angry! I feel so bad! How can we stop this happening? I ask myself what can I do?
I am a filipina catholic and I hate the way Catholic church is against contraception.
if they follow the religion these kind of problems can be avoided.

She&#39;s so beautiful. I wish to marry a Filipino woman.
"What? 12? I live in the Philippines and I didn&#39;t even know that. I thought the age of consent is 18. Plus, the fact that it is a taboo for our country to do it before marriage. Also, 21 is the legal age to get married without parents&#39; consent of both party so this information blew my mind."
Religion is the root of all evil and suffering.
"Just another example of the Catholic church&#39;s negative influence over government and common sense in general.  As long as the Philippines is Catholic, it will poor and over populated."
I am waiting to see some report on Pakistani society
"Man it doesn‚Äôt matter the age of consent, they make condoms all sizes. No excuses"
all the babies half white
Totally disgusting and disturbing while Catholic church is too busy playing with their rule books little girls lives are being ruined. These men should be charged for child rape.  PHILIPINES CHANGE YOUR LAWS
Where is the government of Philippins? Sleep? Or ignoring the epidemic. PASS SOME TOUGH LAWS protecting these children from being raped and abused.
If the Philippines government is so worried about this problem and the related expenses then why is 12 still the age of consent??
Woo I‚Äôm glad my bff‚Äôs parents came to America so she wouldn‚Äôt have to end up like that üôèüèº
Pedophiles exist in the Philippines
If older women could have done this to boys you could have said - &quot;love is ageless&quot; &quot;let the women enjoy&quot; &quot;it is their wish&quot; &quot;if consenting fine&quot;
So ive been with a guy from the phil. And im convinced this is a deep rooted mental illness that is very common in people from there. Controlling men.
Marty AKA Kong King bought me here.
Oh dear god.
I wish I can build houses in poor countries I hate seeing people live like that üò¢
Sad truthüôÅ..
It seems like there&#39;s a pedo problem not a teen pregnancy problem.smh
How can you do this documentary and do nothing.
the philippines is a massively religious country . they drill it inside their heads that contraception is a negative thing ...
this abortions are horrible 5 months that to far along to just kill it heart less.
"12...outrageous!,,,"
"OMG!! I cant even think about having a boyfriend until I got 25th years old, this is where I come from.. the land of palawan.. it is soooooo sad to see this Documentary üò≠üò≠"

PROUD TO BE PUTANG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"All down to the Pope, the head of a made-up religion!"
Age of consent is 12? That&#39;s a child.
I really do not understand why these populations are not neutered to prevent this problem.
"They are poor and keep having babies, that‚Äôs not go to help."
Family planning is great but Marriage needs to be planned out responsibly and that is not at the age of twelve. The Church is right in respecting life but we also can not condone underage marriage.
I wish i had a baby to care to fill like a father liked the other man lord plz gave me the baby to love and to raise will
They&#39;re so young. Why they didn&#39;t use condom? It&#39;s so hard to use?
a gush of blood something ruptured and you&#39;re on your own...thats crazy
Seeing this video we should be glad that we are veryyyy lucky!!! Our childhood is pure and filled with happiness! üòá
These girls yes girls not woman are still children these girls don&#39;t have a voice of their own and are basically being forced to have children it&#39;s heartbreaking
They&#39;re poor counyry and keep having kids... Stop reproducing.

Ignorance is not bliss and actions speak louder than words
Coercion or rape
Just drop a bomb on the Philippines already. It‚Äôs irredeemable
"I think it‚Äôs the Philippines ppls thing to be in a relationship with older mans, Cx in my country also there are lot of Philippines ppl working and many of them are in a relationship with sugar daddy‚Äôs <br>It‚Äôs not blame to men‚Äôs if then."
Some parents need to take their ungrateful teenagers for a visit there. American children have no idea how good they have it!! Pregnant at 11 years old and miscarried!

Don&#39;t trust reporters
"so much potential wasted. the amount of future doctors, engineers, scholars that could have been just gone. all because of the lack of government support, no education and too much dependence of religion to guide your choices."

You got to be fucken kidding me. This is wrong in so many ways.
Oh my üòîüòîüòî I don&#39;t even have word to say. I have 11 years old daughter. This is just sad sad. Poor girl. If I could I will take her away in second from her BF. Raise her just like my daughter üòî

those poor babies...
"guys I&#39;m from PH and seeing this is just really painful, and despite of it. It is real and RAMPANT in our country. I had the opportunity to live in the middle class side of the Philippines but I can still see some of my far neighbours being in this kind of situation. This wasn&#39;t just the painful part, it is also the ignorance and the seemingly not progressing society and culture we have. The locals around me doesn&#39;t even have enough knowledge about the concept of birth control, abortion by choice, contraceptives, legal consent etc. all they know about it is if someo does it, it&#39;s a &quot;sin to God&quot;, &quot;shame to the whole family&quot; they are blinded by the religious concepts and practices we have (since we are a Christian country) another thing is they don&#39;t like talking about this kind of stuff, they rather choose to gossip about it rather than be educated. I&#39;m really hoping in the next years, we may stay as a 3rd world country but the progress in our culture, beliefs and the PH society itself, at the very least will be seen."
These men are pediphiles being allowed to live in the communityü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è such abuse

"He feed  me well...shocking. virginity ,innocence and childhood for food."
Absence is bullshit and it never worked in the past and it will never work in the future
"The parents  there are selling their children to the  highest  bidder, sick!"
The Catholic Church... ever notice how all the catholic countries have way too many kids and poverty?  They really shouldn‚Äôt encourage having lots of kids.  Very irresponsible for the planet and communities!
A life worst then animals....everybody f**king everybody and getting pregnant and leaving them for someone younger and the circle goes continuously.......shit....i am disgused....
&quot; i swear she said she was over 18&quot;
ganun ba kamahal magbili ng condom? is it that expensive to afford condom ?
the sad thing is that they keep getting pregnant yet they dont keep earning money
its a sin to play garter but not a sin to commit fornication ?
that witch performing these completely unprofessional and dangerous abortions on these young troubled girls deserves to hang
This has been going since I first went to the Philippines in 1979. Apathy and religion are powerful opponents.

"My goodness im a filipino and i got consent from my parents to have boyfriend when i already graduated college w/c is 21, what the heck !!!!"
"Imagine raping a 12 year old and having the nerve to show your face on the internet. Someone should bash his face in, alongside the men who decided raping children isnt a crime"
Philippines need to enter the war with china to decrease the population. Sometime we need to sacrifice for the next future generation. After the war all woman must be ligated to control the population and became stable.
WHOEVER SET THE AGE OF CONCENT AT 12 YEARS IS MOST PROBABLY A PHEDOPHILE.
I swear that just child abuse in America your told not to do it until 18
Omg I have a 15 yo daughter. Do her wrong at your peril ‚ò†Ô∏è
It was only a couple of decades ago that Australia raised the age of consent from 12yo to 16yo for females.
"Makes my blood boil. Poor girls, and yet again its the Catholic church pulling the strings. Religion is evil and the reason there is so much pain, misery and wars in the world. People need to wake up and detach them selves from these cults."
Religious beliefs making young women&#39;s and thier children prone to poverty. The is what the right wing pig&#39;s in America would wish for us all.
That NGO laddy  her eyebrows looks like spaghetti üçù
Poverty is a very bad thing
All this suffering just because men have to stick their di*ck somewhere!
Girls need support and education.  This is really sad that girls are being used and abused.
We should ban Chinese Garter..its where it all started..üòÖüòÖüòÖ
These phillipino bad man&#39;s home run on the first date. You go player.
Lovely jubbly lots of cheap labour for businesses.
The missionary may promise to make things better but they will end up much worse. This Catholic nation will replace China for cheap labour and all this oversupply will make it cheap.
"Education, schools, where are the great leaders of this world, why do they want poor nations ( why) is it becaus poor nations are easer to bully , and were deose all the go realy"
The guys can&#39;t totally be blamed cause most of them are too young themselves to understand the consequences of their actions on the girls... They are just succumbing to their natural instincts
Poor girls. The trash was the most upsetting part of this video for me...children playing in trash.
Anybody else got their blood boiling to the maximum level while watching this?. First of all  what pedophiles decided 12 should be an appropriate age for consent? Why are all these abusive  men not castrated?
This is so f***ing wrong.

Another example of men exploiting women... actually in this case it‚Äôs children.

"God has mercy on us all, and more than anyone God bless and look after these poor girls. Not teenagers, not ladies. These little girls üòîüò¢. <br>We in America, don&#39;t realize just how blessed we are."
This reporter should come back to the U.S.A and do the same report. It&#39;s not any different here too
"I did not even have my first period until I was 15 years old. It is insane, how quickly these girls turned into women..."
"And this, ladies and gentlemen, is what happens when you let men and religion make the laws"
How can that guy in such a position of authority suggest that the UN&#39;s idea on family planning isn&#39;t good and that it gets overturned üòµ
Basically bad morals in those slums! Govt can only do little
Some of them are not even teens
The first thing that needs to be changed is the law. And prosecute these men 18 years and over for going after these little girls 1112 1314 years old. It was so so heartbreaking. And those men no better especially in today‚Äôs world. The government needs to get it together.
In the Catholic Church in the Philippines things all this is OK. Well that makes sense considering the Priester raping kids to. Anybody that listens to the Catholic Church need to run.
"Okay, pause at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=12m28s"">12:28</a> what do you see in the frame? <br><br>Once you see it you‚Äôll be like omg cause like this is about ya know?"
Is there an NGO that can set these men raping children on fire?
Why not try to help them better their relationship why try to take the babies father away.. stop interfering in the people lives .. if the dad is a deadbeat them that&#39;s fine but not to break up a family üôÑ
In Thailand kids = poverty. Now lesser new born pop also problem so...
If the country knows that there‚Äôs a serious issue with the amount of babies being produced then Howcome they don‚Äôt up the consent age? I know it would take a lot but in the long run it would help. Put up posters to tell about ways they can protect themselves at the least. The first girl she‚Äôs clearly in need of a home and food. If that‚Äôs what she gets with her man she‚Äôs not going to leave. It‚Äôs probably what every girl there feels and needs. They settle and it‚Äôs sad. If only they could see how the US is. They would see what they deserve
Chris hansen: what are you all doing here?
"Religion, lack of education and poverty, which, unfortunately, seem to be an all too common deadly triple threat, ruin young women&#39;s lives. I have the priveleges of being married to the one, planning a family and having the resources to do it. These women need education band economic freedom. Religion is a personal choice I guess, but the other two are essential to break the cycle. I&#39;m atheist myself, but that didn&#39;t contribute to a successful life or marriage."
Better called Philippines baby factory rather than killing inosent babys or selling the babys.

that guy says he is 28...........RIGHT more like 40
Sick ü§¨
So just so everyone knows once you are over 20 weeks when you lose your baby it‚Äôs a stillborn not a miscarriage. 7 months is roughly 30+ weeks give or take. I just wanted to clear that up because there using the term wrong and I want people to have a clear understanding.
She us just a baby ......a child ...not even a teen this is disgusting to see oh my lordd

This is a rape issue not a pregnancy issue. These girls described being RAPED. Then are unable to have legal/safe abortion and encouraged to stay with their abusers. This is disgusting. They are children for god sake!
I&#39;m sure fistula is rampant in Philippines
He wants the the UN to not allow contraception either he wants everyone to stay poor and ignorant like the community he‚Äôs built
I got my period after 15 how is 12 even the age of consent?
Are there no condoms for men to protect their self ..no wonder the Philippe are all over the UAE
It‚Äôs a rape problem<br>Not a pregnancy problem
"This is so disgusting. These poor girls being raped and hurt by the men in their country, then carrying the babies :("
"Age of consent 12???  ...they are children, children cannot consent :"
Typical scenario around the world. The poor gets abused while the rich can get away with anything.
"These girls need to get on birth control and the consent age needs to be raised to 18. This is despicable! These people are living in squalor conditions. As far as I&#39;m concerned, it is rape. These girls haven&#39;t even went through puberty yet."
Pregnancy loss at 7 months gestation is STILLBIRTH not a miscarriage!!!!
What? ancient preacher still working to harm the society!
If these people don‚Äôt want to press charges move on to someone who do simple

I&#39;m sorry but that guy that said that his disagrees with contraception and thinks people should just abstain till marriage that for work education and contraception works and they should teach their own kids not just rely on schools my mother taught me and I had my first and only baby at 28 so it worked for me I also haven&#39;t had an abortion either

"In about 21. minute, the guy is telling the children to say yes...<br><br>One repeatedly quietly said no. Reminds me of myself in that age. No matter how much you force your authority into teens saying you they won&#39;t do something, it doesn&#39;t mean that they won&#39;t do it. I wish more of them were brave enough to tell them that, or to be more loud.<br><br>Teenagers are not respected enough in the modern societies. They are a second class citizens. I think that the world would be a much better place if the adults would just listen.<br><br>They are not moody because of their hormones, but because of the lack of respect the society gives them. They are expected to behave like adults, while being treated like a child. Then they are punished for not behaving how they are &quot;supposed to&quot; ...<br><br>When they then get pregnant, they were shamed for not listening... I think that they would listen, if they had just been listened beforehand.<br><br>It was sad to hear my high-school mates complain about teens this day at our reunion . Is it so easy to forget?"
So sad for May May. She‚Äôs living with her rapist and blames herself for the miscarriage. Ughhh !!! Wth
These ‚Äúmen‚Äù need to be taught and jailed
"If they are worrying about all the mouths to feed why are they constantly raping woman and getting them pregnant,  they honestly don‚Äôt have a brain... at all!!!"

I&#39;m from Palawan<br>This channel say Palawan have the  biggest rate of teenage pregnancy<br>It&#39;s not truly whole true<br>I hate this <br>They are only fewüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
This is pretty much all the problems that would happen if Abortion was banned in the US and contraceptive was hard to get. Abortion just becomes unsafe and teenage pregnancies will sky rocket. More children and women will suffer.
The problem is having religiots leaders.
That man is not 28 years old his in his late 30s at the most. That‚Äôs just disgusting. Their problem has nothing to do with pregnancy but sexual assault these girls are still children and they are already having kids
This is so painful to watch.
12 is not teenager... it is pre-teen. Yikes disgusting
This video is very disturbing!!! PROTECT OUR CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
can we talk about how the catholic church is basically funding this problem??!
sexually abuse
It&#39;s figures that it&#39;s a christian nation any way you look at it they are ALL the same to me &quot;dearie&quot;
My heart aches for these girls. 12 years old really??!!!
I will take any of those babies and give it a wonderful life....Dog too
&quot; I chose her over my wife because I was scared of charges&quot; ...bet that makes her feel so loved. Smh.
The problem is education and the huge grasp the the Catholic Church has in their estate.
Teen pregnancy: on the rise <br>Catholic Church: <b>sings Breakeven by The Script</b> <br>Contraceptives : üëÅüëÑüëÅ
you think they&#39;re bad white men have been doing it for years.
Its really f****d up in Phillipines.Age forsex should be raised.The leaders are sick
That&#39;s all girls have to look forward to.?having babies.they dont care for girls .in that country.
Theres no miscarriage at 7 or 8 months. It&#39;s a stillborn at that stage
Philippines is a breeding ground and feeding ground for pedophiles
"This is off topic, but at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=7m28s"">7:28</a> she spits and it lands on her neck"
And these girls are being prayed upon my child predators. The law of consent should change and prosecutions or rapist
The USA ban abortion and shut down planned parent hood clinics.  Do they want what is happening in Manila to happen in the USA? There are cities and towns in the USA that have high teen pregnancy rates. <br><br>I had an iud in because I was afraid to get pregnant again. I am very fertile and married. I had the iud in for 18 months and had it removed after the strings wrapped around my uterus causing a lot of pain and blood loss. I refuse to use birth control for this very reason. Hormonal BC or not my body rejects BC and I do not like the side effects. <br>I also do not want my tubes tied or removed because that has side effects too.<br><br>I am on the fence about abortion if a girl is raped and doesn‚Äôt want to follow through with the pregnancy I believe she should have a right to say so. <br><br>Teaching abstinence only goes so far then you start having what church officials deem ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù.
11 ?!?! And he 21 this is crazy we have it made in America
Sabi ng simbahan masama daw ang contraceptives.. Alam nyo kung bakit. Mapipigilan ang pagdami ng tao pagdi namasyado madami ang tao kunti lng makukuha ng aboloy. Kaya ayaw nila ng contraceptives.. Kung maraming ipapanganak na sanggol magkakapera ang simbahan. For example pagbininyagan mo ang baby mo diba may bayad?. Nong binaninyagan si jesus di naman sya nagbayad kay juan.. Bakit tayo magbabayad?.

"As a Filipina myself, I can say that lack of guidance from parents is one of major factor why just by the age of 12 or 13 most of them become pregnant, followed by lack of education... It&#39;s hard to admit it but that&#39;s the reality I&#39;m seeing right now (those living in the slum areas). Those who can&#39;t even find a job or have  decent 3 meals a day has more children..."

"This has been a problem here in the Philippines for a long time since contraceptives are seen as something that would cause infertility especially the birth control pills. Most people here condemn girls who take pills because they see them as ‚Äúsinners‚Äù who have not preserved their virginity to the man that they should marry. Sexual Education is a really important topic that should be taught to the youth for them not to engage into sexual acts but to be knowledgeable about it and to correct myths that stupid ignorant people spread about contraceptives. We are already in the 21st century, folks! Wake up and be open-minded!"
101 east is really hard show to watch. How people lived the show change my seeing. Feeling really sorry for the girls and womens. And when i see girl children in this video its strick my heart what will happened to them
There are a lot of things I disagree with here . But Why is it some other countries business to force our beliefs on them. Yes this is herdendus but not our concerns.
Bruh that pure life movement class is BS. They have a platform but are not treating the root of the problem.
"do they not know what makes babies, yet they have their age of consent at 12. also 28-38 years old dating a minor what a joke<br><br>when i was 12 i was hugging my female friends and hanging out at pizzerias bruh"
How nasty the government that does not take action on eradication of childhood pregnancies
Poor young girl she had no choice because of poverty.  I hope our catholic church and our hypocrite shameless  corrupt politicians here in the Philippines watch this
Baby killers are against humanity! God gave life but baby killers promote to kill the life in the name of so called health. Power of people in the Philippines is the population. But the baby killers promote murder of innocent children. Evil power in our international community is promotion of murder against the innocent unborn children.
Dehek is wrong with those adult/old guys impregnating children...... Sick pedophiles
This poor children are doomed. Its so unfair.

"man, Because Satan rules this world and all people in this world seeks Satan, which is their father. I was in this darkness as well. but I made a decision one just to pick up the Holy Bible and just read it, I asked my wife where do I start she said Proverbs because she asked me what I wanted in life, I said Wisdom, no! not money, not riches, not women none of that vanity stuff. I wanted wisdom. so, I finished the book of Proverbs, then I asked her, where do I start next. she said Genesis. so! I took my journey and I started reading, I read every book in the old testament and then I got to the new testament and I saw all the lies that these churches were telling people about the Messiah Yahusha(Jesus). Yahuah opened my eyes to the truth. and taught me his commandments in the old testament all of them in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus Numbers and Dueteronomy. 613 laws is what I learned, and still learning them today.<br><br>because people in this world refuse his law&#39;s, he has refused the world and gave it over to Satan. and... only those who really wish to see the light which is the &quot;Torah&quot; and instructions on doing good in life. then he&#39;ll turn to that person who seeks him. his name is not god, that&#39;s Satan&#39;s real name Gadr&#39;el take the R&#39;el off and you&#39;ll get Gad, but pronounce it in Hebrew/Ibriy and you&#39;ll end up with GAWD=God both spelled different but both sound the same. you can find this in the book of Enoch, its the only place where Satan forgot to hide his name out of the Scriptures. so, when you call on God, remember your calling on Gawd which is Gadr&#39;el which is Satan. The Most High name is Yahuah.<br><br>The name of the third is Gadr&#39;el: he discovered every stroke of death to the children of men. He seduced Chuah; and discovered to the children of men the instruments of death, the coat of mail, the shield, and the sword for slaughter; every instrument of death to the children of men. From his hand were derived to them who dwell upon earth, from that period forever.  CHANOK (ENOCH) 69:6-8 ◊ê◊™ CEPHER Bible."
age of consent in my country is 16 but with my parents their age of consent is 40 and at their ages i was reading a book or watching ben 10 or spongebob
"&quot;Contraceptives have side effects&quot; 1, you shouldnt be reproducing anyway even if they did and 2. they dont."
This just breaks my heart üò¢ and makes me so angry to like wtf  this could all change so easily . Change the laws and age of consent  and offer free birth control . Save the country alot of money and just fix alot. So sad
"As is sure Religions plays  an important part in people&#39;s life across the globe. There is some negativity in every religion.

"Catholics, the invisible man in the sky &amp; 12 years is the age of consent. All bullshit made up by old men."
Does pressing charges after they have a baby and are living together really a great solution? How will she survive?  It&#39;s too late. Get after the cases earlier before it&#39;s too late..
Horrible catholicism curriculum .... if it was affective then there wouldn‚Äôt be that much teenage pregnancy
"castration, castration, castration, castration.overpopulating them selves. stay poor forever. duh."
12...much too young
Doesn&#39;t make sense to give the kids contraceptives if those older boyfriends don&#39;t want to use it... should start with teaching them !
Those poor girls :(  heartbreaking
What is the flying bologna sandwich is going on here!!! Age of consent 12 but¬†cant use contraceptives without parents permission. These dudes are sick as heck that&#39;s it nothing more nothing less. This¬†is so sad and disgusting!!!
Men in the Philippines are all dicks
When I was 13 years old I was in 7th grade and I remember I only ATE paper üò∂
See how these white feminists try to impose their western family beliefs on to foreign cultures.
This happened when the Spanish colonized the Philippines and eliminated Islam from the Philippines
There needs to be more protection for these girls. Abortions cause more emotional pain as it&#39;s murdering a child but still these girls need support and safety! They need school.
Do you really think that murdering the innocent babies is the best way to address a low age of consent? The innocent infant didn&#39;t choose so why punish them taking the easy way out rather than deal with the real issue which is poverty and a very low age of consent (a legal matter).
Extremely hard to watch
They lied about contraception. And the man took the children!
38 or older?!
they are disgusting they are 11 and blame themselvles for baby wtf ? what the those animals know about life they just overpoplate the world for no reason just have one child not 10 this is a disaster
This is heartbreaking.
"In my country (Indonesia), even people who lack education understand that having many children will make them difficult. That is why the majority of Indonesians now have only 2-3 children"
I hope they took her away from there...clearly young girls are being raped

I feel pity toward tje girls...they get pregnant in very young age...
Where ever there is human misery you can be sure to find the Catholic Church !
That explains well why so many of them are waiting in line to be mail order brides in the United States
The lady that performs abortions should be prosecuted and have her hands chopped off!!!
"This was too hard to watch! Those poor children üò¢ This was not consent, ITS RAPE!!!"
Ah yeah it all goes back to...oh what a surprise RELIGION.
For WHAT I am! No one should feel that low about themselves because they suffered actual abuse.
"Oh I see, so we should teach 12 year olds about condoms properly so she can cont to be raped by old perverts in a safe manner. Great game plan. <br>  The issue isn&#39;t contraception, its child rape."

"This is not just an issue of &quot;unplanned&quot; pregnancies - it is an issue of &quot;rape&quot; of a minor, notwithstanding the violation of a woman&#39;s right to choose.  Also, it is perplexing at best, that the entire film puts the burden of contraception on the female.  The burden is equally on the male - have they not heard of condoms?!  The government and the church are equally complicit - setting a consensual standard at 12 years old, which is reprehensible, notwithstanding the indoctrination of anti-contraception, further perpetuating a culture of pregnancies and the cycle of poverty.  These children should be protected by governing bodies, but instead, have been left to defend themselves against rape and perpetual abuse.  It is morally indefensible."
"Al Jazera please do a documentary on polygamy  in Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. First cousin arranged marriage  and the birth defects that are common in the mid east. You wouldn&#39;t dare look inward would you? Nope only documentaries on racism in the US and birth control in Christian nations."
"&#39;All I knew was how to play Chinese garters, that&#39;s all&#39; god that breaks my heart"
"it&#39;s obviously not that big of a problem for the Government there because more than a dozen families hand build their homes out of stuff from the trash, eating food from the garbage, eating once a day or not at all..jobs impossible to find, needing a birth certificate and have to be baptized in order to enroll in school. Condoms should be free in countries like these, free health classes. atleast once a month for young girls and boys."
Why does abortion have to be the answer? As a catholic from north lreland were abortion is illegal we all take the pill or use protection but we dont want abortion here stop pushing the pro choice agenda by media its not the answer to the problem
Child rape.
If they are being forced to do it doesn&#39;t that indicate rape !? And isn&#39;t rape a crime why aren&#39;t they in jail ( that ones that raped them)

This country has no men
Does anyone know how the adoption process is in the Philippines? Like do these girls even have the option to put their babies up for adoption or is that against the church rules too? I‚Äôm sure if they could they would give their babies the best life but it looks like a vicious cycle and the odds are set up against them from the moment they‚Äôre born. Very sad.
Reason 127827181197 why religion can be hella toxic.
first and foremost 12 is NOT THE AGE OF CONSENT IN THE PHILIPPINES ITS 18 but the main problem is that most family are poor and uneducated that sometimes kids are not well taken care of and guided that prostitution or selling their body to men is the only solution .
Alabama needs to see this for forcing an 11yr old rape victim to give birth.
"Hey Al Jazeera, when will you have a documentary about the widespread abuse of South and Southeast Asians in the Gulf Countries?"
I just don&#39;t get it on how the phillipines government system works

This is crazy‚Ä¶
Why he date a little girl that f**k up
do they sell condoms in phillipines? why in this video only girls @ women need to wear contraceptive?
Excuse me while I go throw up the ton of  ‚ÄúDISGUST‚Äù I am feeling...............
This is the definition of crazy.
Oh well squatters logic. They think having lots of kids will help them in the future.
in kenya some pedo tried to have the consent age reduced to 16  but im glad no one was ready to entertain their madness
All these comments are so naive and uninformed. The reason they didnt prosecute the men is because the girls didnt report them and why is that? Because they have no where else to live and to eat. Its either this or teenage prositution.
Who told u about the 12year old consent?!
This is heartbreaking üíî
‚ÄúForced to do it‚Äù ... Sounds like rape.
This is my country !! I am fully Filipina but born in Northern Ireland.. just hearing about this now breaks my heart.. consent at 12?? iM turNing 12 At AuGuSt 21ST omG!!
Its really none of anyone&#39;s business.  I grew up not believing that is right but thats my beliefs. I am not going to nor do I want to impose my beliefs on others. There is a ALOT of things going on in the world that isnt fair or right but that&#39;s life. I hope to make the Philippines my home one day.
One of the main problems is <b><i>there&#39;s no separation of the church and the state.</i></b> Those priests and bishops were sticking their nose in the government A LOT it doesn&#39;t even make sense!
he defiantly a democrat huh? that Mayer . he packets the money....just like every democrats do.
Life is too short to care but everything is in gods hands
Her eyebrow on @3.30 though
this is problem of child abuse. not pregnancy.

With all your naive notions about the warmness of Filipino spirit(i.e. you tourist). Now you know what they do behind their smiles.
Always remember to think before to unzip.
you dont &quot;find yourself pregnant&quot;
The worse thing that‚Äôs ever happened to The Philippine is The Catholic Church.
"Lol!<br>Why don&#39;t people report<br>the islamic baby factory,<br>BANGLADESH??<br>Many uneducated bangladeshi people say<br>using condom or contraceptive is against<br>their religion. So, they <br>never use that and thats<br>why a very small bangla<br>is crowded with a vast<br>population of 180 million.<br><br>So, these overCROWDED <br>bangladeshis living near<br>border area always try to<br>sneak into other countries<br>like INDIA.<br>Kinda pathetic violation<br>of LAW! Indian peole fr<br>west bengal are suffering<br>a lot for these illegal<br>migrations.<br>You people should report<br>that overCrowded baby<br>factory, Bangladesh!"
More babies much more poverty.
"The Religious Group that is promoting Abstinence....I am sure they mean well..but they are being unrealistic.. Certainly they likely meet some kids who will wait until they are older, but sadly the majority will not wait.. How can preventing such young girls getting pregnant be worse than girls hemorrhaging to death or having Late Term Abortions??   How on earth do they prevent disease?  So terribly tragic."
And why so many tourist in philippins come to put them sperm on her lifes and go with  so many baby with never regret...so where the justice in their country about this proplem ?
Contraceptive issue..more like a predator issue. Poor girls that get manipulated so easily
I&#39;m proud to be Malaysian..at least we are not poor and not marriage early
This is the result when the church gets involved all the time in letting the DOH introduced contraceptives to school/ baranggays.....

It all falls down to not having privilege. Reality is very sad.

Chinese Garters - The Movie
catholic priests doesnt need contraceptives bcoz young boys dont get pregnant.Hypocrisy.
all those poor girls &amp; babys üò≠
law should be implemented against these men
"My daughter is turning 12 and i am very open with her.  We were just talking today that she needs to be out of school,  have a good job can support  herself before she even thinks about having a child"
That is a lie!!!! the legal age of consent in the Philippines is 18 years old.
The Pope has even okayed birth control for this area because of the poverty and birth rates. <br>It&#39;s a lack of education towards contraception.
Then the age of consent should be taken to 18-20 yrs
PROUD TO BE STUPID AND POOR PINOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don&#39;t do  they have marriages there ??
"Im from the Philippines, Less money = More Babies ...."
You always find the poorest places always having the most babies. Guess no work gives them a lot if time to find other things to do.
Why can‚Äôt you just sterilize the guys and teach them not to take advantage of young teenage girls as well ü§î
"The problem not about her pregnancy, but she is too young to pregnant."
you can only blame the catholic church for this they have people completely brainwashed telling  children about ghosts and scaring them to death. what a joke
I love the way she says MONEYYYY
Disgusting
Feel blessed cause born as male :D
As usual the Catholic Church plays a very huge role in this.<br>This is just the tip of the iceberg.<br>Ask yourself where do unwanted babies go?
The Catholic church is using them as breeders to feed their satanic God&#39;s and demons!!!
"That&#39;s the one major problem in the Philippines, it happened to one of my niece there. It is so sad. I hope the government can do something about that."
"None of them know the root of the problem, Philippine is experiencing such problems due to adopting western culture"

I could see why my dad doesn‚Äôt want to go to the Philippines again
That what stop being  fools young girl
Pro-life to extent of anti-contraception? The Catholic church itself is the obstacle to prorgress that needs to be got rid of.
Hi I&#39;m not sure what the . Normal culture . Was before Spanish Catholic . Invaded . And now western 21st century . This is what u need to look at
This.... triggers me on so many levels....
These men having ax with these little girls should be shot
"Could not watch after 5 minutes, so very sad."
I don&#39;t know whether to like or dislike this. The content is so grueling but the awareness is amazing.
Philippines is so messed up. No wonder the country&#39;s median age is only 22 years old.
I got depressed watching this.
Yuk!
Phillipines is just like Brazil
Please educate about condoms this is the only way me and my bf haven&#39;t had children I&#39;m in my 20&#39;s still haven&#39;t figured out my life yet imagine teens this is very important also to prevent spread of STDs.
Government approved pedophiles very sad.
girl will marry 18 years old.. but 12 years childhood.. What is this nonsense..
If the catholic church is so conservative they need to teach they that fornication and adultery is a sin and to abstent from sexual inmorality.
It&#39;s horrible<br>There should some awareness programme from government or some social workers
Oh god
12? i thought it was 18?

Honesty they should be given knowledge of contraception or have a day care at the school so still hopefully some parents could still finish school.
Age of consent should be from 18yrs

"Most of the media network from other countries that make documentaries about the Philippines, they only showed Luzon or the capital city Manila. Philippines has Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao. Visayas and Mindanao are way better than Luzon. In my place in Minadanao we don&#39;t have slums, honestly...and we are thankful that our social workers of each  Barangay encourage  everyone to use contraceptives. The people in my place are poor but we are not that poor like you showed in the video. Most of the people there works in the farm yet they can afford to send their children in school or college. This is just an information for those who did not try to visit  Philippines. You only showed Luzon or Manila as the whole Philippines."

I feel sad because these girls are deprived of any decent education. They have to raise kids or worse abandon them or maybe even harm them! These mothers in the videos no longer look like in their 10 years or twenties; they look old and exhausted. They lost a significant amount of time for something they shouldn&#39;t even be worried about. Motherhood is not something easy. It&#39;s not just feedings and nappy changes. It&#39;s about responsibility. How can a 14 year old girl be responsible? There was a 14 year old in another segment who was blaming herself for the miscarriage simply because she was playing a game that involved hopping and jumping. Well that&#39;s what she is supposed to be doing not worry about pregnancies. And the government should protect these kids. If an all girls school would help or at least push pregnancy ages to 18 or 19 years old that would be a start. Girls are not cats. Girls don&#39;t have to have babies everytime they&#39;re in &quot;heat&quot;. Abstinence is key because i respect that they don&#39;t allow contraceptives it is against their religion and we have to be respectful. But solutions must be provided. The statistics here in this video say 2000 births of the overall 12000 are for teen pregnancies. I pray this finds a solution soon
"My hairstylist is a Filipina mother and i love her so much she is so kind and so well informed. We had a chat last week about how she has this rule for her kids, no marriage before the age of 30, no kids before marriage at all or she stops paying for their school and college fees. She was telling me about her daughter who be getting married in Christmas this year and i was so happy because her daughter is a psychiatrist now and her partner is in the navy and they will have a great family i am sure because at least they are both mature and have a very good income to support their future kids and i was so happy that she shared her thoughts with me. It was so inspiring to see mothers and fathers who instill good manners in their kids."
üò≤
"Honestly the girls are also to blame. Why give consent to something you don&#39;t understand as most of the girls in this video claim?? I think they have a hormonal surge and the girls are not taught abstinence because if they were the Philippines would not put the age of consent at 12? Like wtf!!! I also blame the parents and i blame the church because if people in the Philippines were religious for real they would know it is against the teachings of any biblical religion to commit adultery like the guy who impregnated the 14 yo girl!!! Also, the girls themselves take their mothers and fathers as role models. Most of these girls have mothers who themselves had intercourse at such a young age too! I am so upset and saddened by this! I understand there are cultural differences everywhere in the world and the behavior in this video may very well be tolerated in the Philippines but it&#39;s high time the youth and the people who have access to books and schools and internet start teaching those who think this is acceptable and start raising awareness."
Wow I didn‚Äôt know this was happening in the Philippians. It‚Äôs so sad and disturbing how the government isn‚Äôt doing anything about it.
SICK MAN!!!!
Sometimes lack of parents guidance is to blame to
Is the president knows this?

"There is an inherent shame with regards to sexuality within the culture of the Philippines, this is why talking about it is not likely going to happen leaving people uneducated towards the matter, but guess where it came from?... from the wrong interpretation of religion."

This is statutory rape. Her boyfriend is to old for her. She is just a child how can they allowed this. All that babies that get babies. What is this country gone do with all this children. They are already poor but they still make babies. What happens to contraceptives. Surely the government can private contraceptives or is this a culture thing too.
Which country isn‚Äôt a baby making factory now?

They need proper counseling
You don&#39;t have to be religious to attack the problem there&#39;s only 1 solution: condoms.
11 and a 22 year old. This country is pedophilia heaven.
"This one is the sad truth about here in our country Abortion here is illegal , many uneducated  about contraceptives and even if they learned about pills they still afraid to take it because knowing it has a side bad effect on their uterus. Condoms and pills are given free from selected Clinic here,  but still the GOVERNMENT doesn&#39;t educated the people well on how to use this. And lack of care  from the parents for the teenagers. Unlike any other countries our own land have it&#39;s own problem. Poor  sad overpopulated country but We still have many good things  you can find here in our country Philippines."

What a joke you need a parents consent for contraception yet 12 is legal to rape. Ignorance is all these people know.

"The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage PERSON from sexual advances and sexual exploitation. A minor is not yet fully developed, not only the body is not ready to carry on a risk free pregnancy but the brain prefrontal cortex is underdeveloped, which impairs autonomous and rational decision making, besides that fact, women are teach since infancy to consider men needs over their own so sexual cohesion is done easily, also religion reinforce this idea that the primordial function and reason to exist for a woman is conception, they block sexual education, legislation making, law reinforcement, contraceptive methods and sexual heath care for women."
i like that puppy..
Omfg what is wrong with the world
These men are sick! such a shame
i&#39;m from the philippines and im not quite sure of the legal age of consent at 12. i need some fact check here.
SORRY BUT ALL THE PLASTIC :[

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there&#39;s sexual abuse from early that&#39;s not explained in the story too....... I wish this type of thinking would stop.. Those poor babies"

"They have such beautiful babies. Hopefully parents starting talking with their kids more. I know its awkward. My oldest is 13, hes been talked to about any and everything. Yes. It was uncomfortable, but id rather him know how to protect himself."
It shocks me that they rely on the &quot;self-control&quot; of teenagers...they should learn about contraceptives and have it easily accessible.
let‚Äôs just restart this whole country
"HOW IS THE CONSENT AGE 12?! Nobody fears the law, because it&#39;s lawful...shocking"
I think the church should separate them self  from education.
Immorality trends in poor countries
It‚Äôs even happening to Filipino teens living here in Canada... this year two of my classmates just gave birth to their childs. Ironically one of the fathers of the babies is part of an ultra-conservative church.

"The doctor phrased it very well: &quot;it&#39;s a crisis and without finishing their schools, the cycle of poverty is never broken&quot;<br>History tells how spending money on religion and spirituality works in favour of poverty, not against it or for the poor.<br><br>Preaching chastity works only as long as they are chaste, once that has passed many seem to feel less &quot;worth&quot;. Proper sexual education gives many other reasons besides staying &quot;pure&quot; to not have intercourse yet, considering how many become pregnant while underaged it is obvious that relying on religion has backfired, but all those holymen are either too proud, blind or greedy to admit and fix their issues.<br><br><br>Just one of countless saddening events where we learn what happens, when the majority of funds and education works in favour of religion instead of science and knowledge."
"Interesting,  ----  be for the philippines had a Anti American president <br>We never heard of all this in the media?? ( fake news)? now it&#39;s everywhere,"

Thw catholic church needs to stop corruption on the government.  They just benefit from people donations. Disgusting
The cycle of poverty continues... Lack of education and ignorance.
I wish I could save these young girls
when the church is that fancy; you can trust it&#39;s bad. churches are a big business hiding behind  God and tax free. i feel like the one place i never felt God was at church. i wonder how many of these babies are mixed from some old creepy white dude.. same creepy dude i see going to church!
This is soo sad.

"This was truly heartbreaking.... We are sooo lucky to have the right to CHOOSE here in the UK. We have plenty of choices when it comes to contraception, we have the right to have an abortion if we choose that option, we have the right to have a baby if we want one. We‚Äôre lucky! Plus IF we have a baby or get pregnant young, then we get benefits or council housing. We‚Äôre lucky."
"So...... The age to buy contraceptives is 18, but the age of consent is 12?!!! And the &quot;side effects&quot; of birth control are worse than having a litter of kids that you can&#39;t support? These women are being taught so much ignorance and  lies. It&#39;s so sad."
You know if Chris Hansen was there every one of those pedo&#39;s would be arrested! That is seriously sick
its straight up pedophilia! Dont care what country it is these children dont understand what is being forced on them
"I hate the fact that the interviewer kept repeating the &quot;age of consent is at 12 years old.&quot; like, that&#39;s one huge accusation you got there gorl."
correction: consent by 12? that is FALSE. the Philippines as a Christian country does not support young relationships. I think this is a sexual assault problem as well as the fact that some do not have access to the knowledge of how these things work.
"The boy who said people are weak. I hope he grows up and gets a good job, and then a family. He seems like, a good person."

"Here in philippines even passing a RHBill that will help educate people about birth control and guving free contraceptive is harly pass to our law bcoz of catholic churches who disaggree to this Bill. Catholic church here is killing people,theyre not helping."
If you cannot provide for her just don&#39;t report him
The Philippines has such high rates of birth they sell their daughters. They can&#39;t feed them. Thank you Carholic Church.
Catholism is killing Phillipines. Lack of education and contraception.

"I&#39;m from Philippines too, I think the parents should be more strict! <br>Me when I was a kid until I&#39;m teenager, my parents not allow me to use cellphone, until I&#39;m in the age of 20&#39;s...

"this is equal measures frustrating as it is infuriating, its essentially legalised paedophilia in a nation where the church doesn&#39;t allow contraception..it beggars belief the hypocrisy and the grave contradiction that exists in the Philippines..."
Currently living in the Philippines and I did not know that the legal age of consent is 12?! Like I cant even be in a relationship until I graduated college. And I even live in the rural area. Now 25 I still cant even get married until I own my own house. Maybe this is an issue that my country turned a blind eye on.
Age of consent is 12??!? This is crazy
This is absolute total BS! I can almost bet that most of these pregnancies are due to a sexual assault problem like the person below me mentioned. Some of them are freaking 12!!
"Young girls need to know their self-worth and that they have value, not just babymakers..."

I lived there in the Philippines and I seen this problems all the time. They just don&#39;t learn. They see it all around them but the problem is they don&#39;t think it will happen to them. The Government only think of putting more money in their pocket is why not what he said. It all about filling there pocket with money. They just don&#39;t care. I see kids on the streets  living there begging for money.
"wtf is wrong with filipino society? parents allow little girls to hang out with middle aged men? its not a pregnancy problem, its a cutural disaster"

It&#39;s their country not your country a different way of life. Sounds like white prude white people sticking their noses where it doesnt belong
I spent 2 years in the philippnes and I was baffled by the number of pregnant young girls. People here in the comments said it&#39;s forced but it&#39;s really fault of the culture and the national mindset. Religion plays a very big part and being a Catholic myself I am surprised to learn that even educated people believe contraception is against the religion. The culture is such that girls want to have babies without thinking about the consequences. Choice of a partner is really screwed up. It&#39;s the religious political and cultural problem. The government is doing nothing and the parents are ignoring and turning a blind eye to what&#39;s happening with their girls and even encouraging their boys having gfs and babies with girls any age.
How many of these babies are simply dumped in the rivers and woods? How many girls are found dead from this fate??
Why do they smile while telling of the pain and abuse they suffer?
"16 gave birth,and pregnant again few weeks later...soy power..........."

"What in the world is this??? Omg! I am not judging but whattttttt??? I cannot contain myself. Hearing a 12 years old say loosing a child is painful leaves me SHOCKED! You sure Philippines is a country for Miss Universe, are you sure women are empowered here?!? I don‚Äôt know but this is a nightmare. I am contemplating if I should watch the video or not?!!"
I am actually shaken!!
"I couldn&#39;t get past 6 mins into this film... As a Filipino this makes me so depressed. This is one of the root causes and foundation of MOST things wrong in this country. Even with the Reproductive Health Bill in place, it&#39;s always the execution and implementation that&#39;s weak... The Executive branch of the Philippine government is one of the weakest in the world. (The Judiciary is a close second)"
Pro lifers should watch this
Anglilibog kasi. ayaw magcondom kasi di masarap.
How sick and twisted
Disgusting. How can you let these abusers live like this
Knowledge is power and ignorance is not bliss!
"Everyone should have a right to life even if you&#39;re born to a poor or broken family.  A lot of these babies which the west is pushing to be aborted will one day be fishermen, farmers, carpenters, nannys, caregivers. Low end jobs that are necessary. Look at Japans aging population, their hiring Filipino caregivers because their own population can&#39;t take care of them. People are expected to live even longer now."
this is so sad...
WTF consent should be the same age as your ability to vote. It&#39;s absurd.
This is so concerning issue hugely affects towards women‚Äôs rights as well as the the country‚Äôs growth
"What a backward country, put the dirty old bastards in prison.and get the government to put laws and stuff 8n place,There are too many people in the world with out accidents of births that they then abort .its disgusting"
This is sick
Haiiiiiiist problima nga ng pilipinas letchee nga
Why the government should fund the contraceptive ? individual actions is individual responsibility.  <br><br>We buy condom here in Japan and it&#39;s not free .
There&#39;s a lot of young mother in the United States too. But this is different story because the country looks like neglecting its citizens.but remember your actions is your responsibility.
"the girl on the left at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=22m21s"">22:21</a> is so pretty like wwh at"
"Control thr MEN,  it&#39;s the men only who is destroying nature,  women all around the world.  Control the men and nature is controlled,  no need to control women,  women are harmless,  loving creatures.  Child pregnancy of phillipines i never knew about it until  now,  had seen their movies but never knew this ugly reality.  # from India"
Ito yung masakit eh. Yung mga wala pang kamuwang muwang na mga bata ang nagkakaanak pero kame nasa tamang edad na may maginhawang buhay pero di binibiyayaan ng anak üíî
This is so sad to see...I really hope the age of consent will change soon!
I say no thank you to the priest
Reasons I don‚Äôt want to live in Ph part *I lost count
dont they know what condom means lol
"Well.. up until now... This issue is still the same.. unfortunately, not just pregnancy but all health-care issues are neglected! Health care system is poor.. üò¢"
Too young for her to has a baby.
Poor country. Filipino has no brain
This is how very stupid our community is. They don&#39;t  care about the children of our nation. They don&#39;t  care about the suffering of many. They like to maintain their backwards ideologies just to maintain what is &quot;good&quot; in their views and they limit their reach up to some point. Sigh.
"Age of consent is 12 and legal age to get contraceptives, 20 something.. that‚Äôs a nice little recipe for disaster.. some of these young girls get pregnant at a very young age and then have miscarriages and then get pregnant again. I think they are doing this on purpose.. they just want someone to look after them and that is very sad.."
"wow, such an in-deep research! good job"
a patriarchal system  can&#39;t exist without women supporters...
Verry sad history in her life
Guys if we‚Äôre going to be honest girls as young as 13 in America are pregnant too
she so beautifull
They need to put sexual education available and put it in the schools. These men are predators! They need to be charged and these parents need to put their foot down and see the world around them. And the age of consent 12? What kind of pedophile made that?
The music back ground is origin Bali... wwwkk
There r two types of gods 1st one  created us and the 2nd one was created by us so do whatever u feel like there r no restrictions. And I&#39;m not saying that u should become an atheist but it&#39;s 21st century u gotta upgrade the religion( and use contraceptives)  üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
. Philippines is a banana republic. .
I love philpines
"I wonder why I hate the church guy the moment I saw him spoke, then he said he didn‚Äôt believe in contraceptive. No wonder he comes off as so creepy and pervy."
Lack of education and parental guidance. Poor Filipina women :((
Japan Needs This
"This makes me sad and angry at the same time.. this is a cultural issue! The fault is parents fault, who can not be 100% blamed cuz they probably went through the same experience.. But it&#39;s totally the church and government&#39;s fault because they forbid the contraceptives!!! I mean?? They prefer decrease their country&#39;s economic and have a high level of poor/ child abuse, and a lower level of education than approve the policy of using contraceptives???? I just can&#39;t understand. <br>God be with these young girls. I hope things will change"
"I like the content of the video, I just hope that they put subtitle instead of translating voice."
"im literally crying,poor girls..."
√áatholic = no contraceptive?
If you want to control people( to become slave) make them poor! That&#39;s what religions and gov&#39;t politics are doing.
No! The age of consent here in the Philippines is 18 y/o not 12 y/o! Al Jazeera please get your facts straight!!!
The Philippines is one messed up country. They need the Biblical Jesus. Not the Catholic Jesus.
"This is why abortions need to be made legal because even if abortion was made illegal women would still have them but but themselves at great risks and even death. Is so unfair to make a law against somebody‚Äôs body is utterly stupid! Women will still continue to have abortions weather is illegal or not. This just makes me furious, most of theses problems are linked to religion no way am I saying religion is bad but many laws in countries are made because of religion and I think is wrong I‚Äôm sorry but some laws are just very stupid and people can‚Äôt use religion as an excuse anymore."
The Phillipines have a Catholic religion problem and as is the case it is the poor women who pay the highest price.
isn&#39;t this called pedophilia ???????? !!!!!!
"It&#39;s interesting that as long as they are aligned with their Catholic values, the Church doesn&#39;t care about young girls getting pregnant. It seems very anti-Catholic to me in terms of being caring, kind, and thinking about others. Education? Sure but if it doesn&#39;t work to this extent, you have to re-think that approach. Also, because of no contraceptives, it&#39;s actually sending more and more girls to abortion, which is very anti-Catholic - interesting that the Church doesn&#39;t see how their actions/values are actually creating the thing they don&#39;t want and even worse, for these girls who keep their babies, they are in poverty and being taken advantage of by older men. Catholic values (not all) leading to such negative things unfortunately."
when god said go and multiply.. he didn&#39;t meant to be like this...
I&#39;m a Filipina but I didn&#39;t know about this 12 y/o consent....
"Now i realise there are many Philippines,,the one i see in movies and the one that&#39;s here"
They have taken Bible seriously
The ignorance and religiosity affecting the lives of these poor girls
Baby factory? How creative...
"Watch out people of the Philippines,  planned parenthood is comming to kill your babies."
ŸàŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖŸá
"Then they all go to neighbouring country to be a club singer, GRO or prostitute... gov pls do something!"
I&#39;m a Filipino and i didn&#39;t even know that the legal age is 12!? seriously!?
SHOCKER--the problem is the legal pedophiles.
Shout out from BCC School HAHAHAHA nice one
"I mean religion is not bad, (personally I am not part of any religion) but the government and the people shield their filthy acts by saying that religion  allows them...<br>I wish they realized that this is such a mayor issue and that these girls are being emotionally, and physically manipulated and mistreated. To me this girls are treated unfairly and are put on such a low place it&#39;s disgusting üò†<br>I wish I could go to every school in the Philippines and teach all these people about contraceptives and making it more public.  <br><b>I would talk about this more because it&#39;s a problem that needs to be fixed!</b>"
"This is really sad, we really needa be more grateful to what we have"
12 is not the age of consent in philippines. Im a Filipina and my family raised us well and the age of consent is 18 or even after finishing college. It really depends
Legal age of consent here in the PH is NOT 12. It&#39;s 18!! Get your facts straight.
This makes me very sad... she was smiling when she said she was forced... I feel so much despair
"I imagine A 38 yr old man and 13 yr old child goes shoping<br>Salesman:Here ,Sir we have a beautiful dress for your child.<br>Oldman:She is my Wife,Watch your mouth!<br>Salesman:Oh,Shit,i forgot this is phillipino."
"At least they have children and therefore a family, it‚Äôs better than being all alone. I‚Äôm 28 and losing hope"
I sometimes complain about my life how nothing is going right. Then I watch something like this and I realise how blessed I am. I hope they have a better future someday üôÅ
"not only in philipines, in Hong Kong too."
They say they didn&#39;t want to do it ...teen girls..now ..pregnant because of rape...that&#39;s the problem..poor girls
The common denominator seems to be the Chinese skipping rope game.. Perhaps that needs to be banned as the guys are obviously picking up the girls when watching them play that game
That‚Äôs why EDUCATION is very important in the Philippines üáµüá≠. Poverty is everywhere in the Philippines and education is the only tool that can help us to be out of that system. When you have a education you can easily find a nice job and you can help your family. That‚Äôs the reason why I did my best to be able to finish my studies and find a good job despite the poverty I‚Äôve been through. Being in a relationship never become my priority even until now. I need to be stable in life first before entering into relationship. I know Philippine Government needs to do something to help its people and educate them regarding the importance of education.God Bless us.
"Having been to the Philipines several times and staying over a month in Aklan, Nabas, Kalibo, province; Manila, Caticlan, ilio, roxas, and many more areas, I can say this video is literally very exaggerated in some areas. It is a developing country there still, some of what you cover is to be expected. Not every country is evolved to the same level of others. It just felt like more of a Drama. They go to Witch Doctors for abortions, it‚Äôs no secret and almost every woman I have ever talked to there, knows about it. I learned Tagalog to literally have a closer bond to the people there, I‚Äôve heard their problems and stories. Some of the video was great, but some was a little misleading when compared to other locations. I would‚Äôve covered the stories of young woman and even older woman, working to support all of their families, even over seas in Saudi Arabia and other countries. Their struggle would be something too hear, a lot of this was also a similar to an agenda and maybe could have been more talked about with less of a bias. No male problems were talked about or their pressures from families to have children. It was leaned slightly and dramatic. Salamat po"
when I was 11 to 13 years old I was still watching spongebob and Phineas and Ferb

"This is one of the few reasons why religion is so dangerous; those who twist it to their own demonic mandates then release their twisted teachings on those who are misinformed perpetuates a vicious cycle .  &quot;Why did I commit such a sin that I played garter?&quot; <br><br>REALLY!!!?????<br><br>She&#39;s a child! That&#39;s what she&#39;s supposed to be doing, playing games with her peers. Not being a piece of manipulated property to some scumbag degenerate."
"Her babies are so cute, jst wanna squeeze them and I pray to god that He will bless you and your babies."
Mostly in manila
They need to get rid of NGO&#39;s in the world. They divide countries and ruin communities
Philippines women are known for having children and have western men looking after them. Conning western men!
R.Kelly got a new address
What is she gonna dp whn he chooses someone younger n a few yrs

That yt woman sounds very rude and condescending. Yuck.
12?JESUS
"All offense intended, it‚Äôs stuff like this that makes you think maybe government and religious rules are wrong."
Will they allow for adoption?
"The guys on this going after young girls are sick, horrible people."
A country who hasn&#39;t escaped the hatred of the feminist agenda.  If a woman hits you. hit her back and give her a good tasted of gender equity.
(why do a lot of women do Vocal Fry )<br>get all baby&#39;s an injection which make them infertile....problem solved
This is so very sad :(
alam mo na ngang hirap ka dadagdagan mo pa ang anak mo. tatang tanga din eh. maawa naman sana ung iba sa mga binubuo nilang anak isipin man lang kung kaya nilang pakainin o buhayin sa maayos na lugar..
This is so upsetting to watch!!
Di Filipino menang banyak gadis umur 15 tahun sudah mempunyai anak Dan hidup di pinggiran
"dude, this is sad"
"It&#39;s not growing. Gosh this video, teenage pregnancy has been steadily dropping!"
Developed countries = birth control
"Ignorance and Corruption by the churches is the problem. Poverty makes people susceptible to blind faith and these priests and bishops takes advantage of this. Its sickening how people treat people, dogs are much better."
How do they deal with trauma. These are just broken families.
Sometimes i wonder what a Warhammer 40k Underhive would look like for normal folk.. Guess i can find my answers here.
They should REALLY change the age of consent!! It‚Äôs too young.
Moral Lesson : Don&#39;t ever dare to have an older boyfriend.
"The same thing is taking please in America , but the girls is having abortion"
Sexual assault entered the chat
Kakaloka nmn<br>S mga eskwater lng nmn maraming ganito
They‚Äôre not ‚Äúgating pregnant‚Äù on their won... they‚Äôre being raped
It is painful to hear a child that worry about her own child. She should be playing and enjoying her youth
All this responsibilitiy about birth controls contraception for pre-teens?!! They expect 12-18 yr old girls living in 3rd world countries to be more aware of their bodies and actions than the grown men assaulting them?!!
these girls just ruin their own life
12 ????  what ??!! The age of consent is 18 in India !
"Seriously speaking I am speechless, I am just sad what&#39;s happening to the world....."
The moral of the story is... Chinese garters is very effective at getting you pregnant
One more reason to be glad that I&#39;m an atheist.
"yooooo my son said &quot;if you shout, you did that in pleasure&quot; and shes kinda right"
"I don&#39;t think contraceptives have to do anything with religious beliefs. In fact, they were invented for a reason. I don&#39;t want to judge anyone but are these females stupid? And half the men here should be in jail."
This is called garbage factory
Omg why is the government not putting those paedophiles in jail for life!!!!
unrelated but i wish they had used subtitles instead of dubbing it
Something is so WRONG. I thought CATHOLICS were niceüôÑ
Commit a crime three meals and a cot has to be better than the streets
Anyone else saw the title<br>The Philippines&#39; Baby Factory | 101 Eats
This isn&#39;t surprising when you look at the colonial history of the Philippines.  Catholicism is the main factor to this tragedy as well as uneducation.
This is from another era really.

An abortionist says a prayer...ü§î Wow so scary how it is performed
so many beutiful women..
can we adopt one baby.
There is no GOD.¬†¬† This world is bad all around.
It‚Äôs embarrassing that NGOs are making more effort to educate these young women  than our government who are receiving their quinsenas or monthly salary.
This is heartbreaking....these young girls are being manipulated and used and then these children are brought into this dysfunctional world.
Reupload
once again the FN ignorant catholic church u talk about letting girls get pregnant but the ahole is doing nothing to look after these girl only thing he care about how much money he can scam
If there were laws forcing the boyfriends to pay for the kids married or not might help.    Just like a dog or cat with so many kids.
DON&#39;T BLEAM RELGEN AND GOVERNMENT&#39;S BLEAM THE PARNTES.<br>KIDS WHEN THEY HAVE KIDS <br>THEY DESTROYED KIDS LIFE.<br>ONE LOVE
Education is the key.
I&#39;m a filipino and this is really saddening üòî
"Banyak anak itu bagus jika dididik dengan Syariat Islam. Tolong pemerintah pelajari tentang Nabi Muhammad SAW. Kita ada sekarang ini berangkat dari suatu kesalahan. Tidak berdasar pada Syariat Islam yang sebenarnya. Ingat anak itu adalah aset. Belatung saja aset, apalagi anak. Solusi satu-satunya adalah syariat Islam, bukan tegnologi. Tegnologi hanyalah sebuah penunjang manusia bukan dasarnya mengatur kehidupan manusia menjadi baik dan teratur."
"stop blaming woman&#39;s abuse and rights violation on Islam. it is apparent in every religion, so it should be clear now that it is cultural and societal not religion related."
Filipinos must be one of the most sexually-active people. A religious people not religious enough to engage in morally-loose behaviour.
Government and NGO has to do something for this kid
"Leave them alone, success or failure start within their selves."
Poor mei mei.she just a little girl ‚òπÔ∏è
"Leave these people alone to sort out their own issues.  Every time global governments (rich ppl) step in and try to &#39;improve&#39; things, it only gets worse.  They did fine for thousands of years before rich man shows up to shake fingers at them, they&#39;ll do fine when rich man goes away and leaves them in peace."
Very sad... Very2 sad üò≠üò≠üò≠
97 % of people hold 3 % of the wealth. 97 % of wealth is held by 3 % of the population. These 3 % have all interest that this situation stays the same forever. One important tool is keeping them eternally busy with social problems they can&#39;t solve.
I&#39;m watching this because I&#39;m a teenage and m 5 months pregnant.
I&#39;m sure the Pope have some good advice for these people.
Phillipines one of the most screwed places......very sad. Catholic church has done nothing for these people.
It‚Äôs so depressing!! :(
This people make sick.
taking on responsibility doesn&#39;t mean just being there physically and THAT&#39;S IT. it&#39;s about caring and loving them and providing for them. having 4 children before her just means that the chance of him finding next wife and doing the same to current girl is high.. as a female myself i feel sad... :(
sighhh
The government and the catholic church is to be blame in the first place.
Not wanting to support abortion is one thing but being against contraception is stupid and irresponsible!
Age 12?!
"USA take a look, this is where you are heading..."
"I worked with a lot of philippinas. They all had european husbands, but one had a child when back in the philippins. She was 18, forced to marry the alcoholic father. Once you have a kid, as a woman, no body will employ you. So you are dependend on your or the babys fathers famile..."
Age of consent 12? Really?.. The legislators must all have been pedophiles..
"Keep these people OUT of the United States.¬† They want to continue on with their abuse/ignorance of girls/women/children.¬† If they are allowed into the US, then they will just bring their cultural ignorance here and perpetrate their evils ways here.¬† KEEP THEM OUT OF THE US!"
"Religion, messing up and damaging mankind since it&#39;s birth. It&#39;s about time we alter it or get rid of it, permanently."
SICK TWISTED ITS JUST NOT RIGHT
What do you wish for?<br>Peace.<br>Do you know how to obtain it?<br>Pulls out sword* Only one.
And Where‚Äôs are the late these of kids I would of like hear there perspectives
She has boyfriend at 12 years??? üò≥ü§¢
lack of education :((
"Who is this American women think she is, yes it‚Äôs bad that this is happening, but she has no right to say anything about this issue.  Leave them alone, they don‚Äôt want your help!!! And even if they did want help, I think the first person to do so are the parents and Philippine authorities, not you....geez get over yourself, you must be one of those women‚Äôs rights activists."
I don&#39;t really understand is that you got pregnant and you decided 2 be pregnant again i mean you can&#39;t even afford the first baby like wtf.
"Catholic state told people breeding more and more , no birth control , just like Islamic state."
Teach them about the menstrual cycle and what days are fertile

Too much freedom can hirt too
My Prayer  is with you.
"No wonder if duterte hates catholic church, shame on them.. I think duterte must kill pedofil also.."
Its fucken sad. In the end the ines who suffer are tons of children who had no part in this madness.. just poverty and suffering and hunger.  And the cycle continues...those babies grow up..atleast some of them and they do the same thing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Are the people making these laws high on drugs? Age of consent is 12 but anyone under 18 can&#39;t buy contraception without parental permission? Then it&#39;s possible to press charges if the partner is over 18? Why not increase the age of consent and put in place laws to protect these children against RAPE. WTF IS WRONG WITH THESE LAWMAKERS!
I feel bad for that puppy but also for these poor girls they deserve the world
It‚Äôs shocking a pedos wnonderland shocking it should be 18 wall over the the world
"I think, when you&#39;re old enough, wise and mature enough, when you acquired a broad perspective of what life is (in all classes: education, work, love, marriage, responsibilities, etc), and when you meet that one person who completes you, it&#39;s nice to think &quot;I want us to have a baby, both of us to share part in it because I love that person&quot;. <br>Therefore, a baby is NOT an &quot;oops&quot;. A &quot;baby&quot; is a little human who needs some good conditions to grow and become a great human. A baby is not something that should come out without preparation and awareness of its importance. A baby is a seed of love, a baby should be the consequence of two people truly LOVING each other (and there&#39;s a HUGE difference between loving and being in love). This love that exists between these 2 people is unique, that&#39;s why it is set apart for MARRIED PEOPLE ONLY . And now that they&#39;re married, they bestow their full love upon their fruit (their child). <br>If I would ever meet that one person, my only reason to have a child would be because I deeply love my partner and I want to hold in my arms the seed of our love, to look at our child and think &quot;what&#39;s his, is mine too&quot;. It&#39;s the beauty of realizing &quot;Hey, we made this miracle together&quot;. But when I see all these little children out there, it makes me want so badly to adopt as many as I can handle and to give up on my desire to have my own child. <br>If God gives me days to live, I want to adopt at least a child and to influence people around me to do the same. All of them who can.. let us set good roots and raise great humans from all the less fortunate little people."
Sad..sad..sad..
The age consent needs to be risen <br>it‚Äôs ridiculous that child didn‚Äôt get to be a child at all
Get you education first......And understand your rights....but then again theirs a pill that stops pregnancy after rape.... Sorry no one Has the right to steel seeds .
There needs to be a law...to protect childern so they can get their education........keep your legs closed
"These people claim to have great respect for life but their laws and policies actually demonstrate a serious disregard for life. If you respect life so much, you should have policies that enable life to thrive. This includes contraception and increasing the age of consent."
the kids are young but they look too old for their own age because of the things they have had to endure.  the gap between the rich and the poor in this country is sooooooo big that seeing people in such a state and the government is doing nothing is so heart breaking. and all these men making these children have children...
They all must be related to R Kelly
I hope the newly elected leaders of the country do something about this. I hope this issue be addressed.
"First of all United Nations is the most disgusting organization I have ever seen. Second of all, this is more about a society who needs a great deal of education when it comes to men seducing young girls. Thirdly it is not about abortion, having the schools educate children about sexual conduct, and government control. Like the little girl said, It is better to be educated than ignorant. Perhaps the men in this society need to be educated on what is expected of them when it comes to soliciting a girl under the age of 18, what the consequences will be if they break this law, and to encourage men of integrity like the priests of the Catholic religion to stand up and show dignity, respect, and value females of all ages. Perhaps the mindset of the speaker is the one who needs to start changing her perspective in order to help those around her whom she seeks to help. It is one thing to enlighten people on what is going on around the world, it is another thing to take the rights of the people out of their hands and give it to the government. Socialism never works and should never be implemented in any of these societies. Teach the mothers how to have conversations with their daughters, teach the father&#39;s how to be a provider, a protector, and an example to his children, especially his sons. If the father is around and a good example, the daughter will seek a better man. Hold people accountable. Abortion holds nobody accountable. Hold these men accountable for seducing young girls, a slap on the wrist and a unwanted marriage is not accountability. Another way of holding people accountable is adoption. This is a win-win situation. The child giving up a child for adoption could be very well taken care of, the child has a better chance of thriving and feeling love from an adopting family, and the female giving birth will be able to recover much quicker, suffer less, less suicides will be performed, depression will be lifted, and a joy within her heart because she helped someone else have a child who was not able to have one of their own. Abortion is not the solution, nor bashing down churches. Supporting the family unit, education, and giving hope to the mother of the child will bring greater and lasting solution."
Family  talk  is  more  important  and education  too
I have been to the Philippines about 4 times and I will tell you This is a real thing happening and it&#39;s not a joke . It&#39;s happening all around the Philippines and it&#39;s not a good thing to be seen .
"May God help them, and for them to know the truth"
"This is sickening poor those girl. Predators  all over there . Wtf , that government  is full of bull and here are the real problems  in the world  so sad may God  protect you girls"

üòÜ he ain&#39;t 28
I can‚Äôt believe she is feeling guilty for being a child; simply playing a children‚Äôs game and losing her innocence- then the fact that moron taunts her for having a physically and emotionally painful miscarriage. I am sobbing rn.
its wrong but this is not england or canada and america other nation also do the same or worst look at the so called middle east
will documentaries ever talk about high class human trafficking
Legal age of consent is 12? Are you freaking serious? I was scared the first time and I was over 20yrs old! This is mad. This country must be run by pediphiles!!!!!!!!! She thinks its her fault to lose a child? It&#39;s her body telling her she is way too young.
"It&#39;s not that simple.... for this goes way, way, way back of negligence, even from those that are called &quot;learned&quot; from the first world countries,  which play now as &quot;protagonists,&quot; wherein they themselves are the main source of iniquities in most the world.  Amen.  &quot;God requireth the past&quot; - this maybe a religious statement but it is sovereign truth.... I am not justifying everything wrong and disordered here (Philippines as baby factory,) though...."
"This is what the church does!!!! Religion is EVIL, I&#39;m an ex Catholic!!"
It feels even sadder when you can understand what they&#39;re saying.
Poor girl...dont be shy to ask condom to health center.just go ask for the future of yours.
"Lord.. God Almighty. I call upon your grace, guidance, love and mercy. Whatever Your will may it be done on earth as it is in Heaven.. The changes this world requires to live in alignment with you.. May it be done today! This hour! This minute! This second! May the lost be found.. May the innocent be protected.. ü§ó Hunger and suffering are not tools for the wicked... This is not the life God willed. This will get better in the precious mighty name of Jesus! Amen Amen Amen!‚ú®üôèüèº‚ú®"
They should teach them about contraceptivesüò™
It‚Äôs so bad seeing that there‚Äôs communities still in the Philippines that struggle and are so underdeveloped because the government doesn‚Äôt care about them... then u see in the cities traffic jams of Ferrari‚Äôs it‚Äôs so sad to see the contrast... why can‚Äôt every one be equal...üòì
How is this even allowed? why is no one told. This is awful. Evil world we live in. Too week to deal with truth.
This is not a story about pregnancy. This is a story about the legalization of child rape and molestation.
Can the World get anymore DEMONIC living in Every SIN ON  Earth.....we have become non Humans....SMHüôèüèΩ
"Curious lang ako sa mga lalaki pero hnde lahat,bakit hnde makontrol ung kating nararamdaman porket may katabi na babae.hnde u ba maisip na baka dumami mga anak nyo or magkaron ng sakit ung partner ng ng dahil sa sunod-sunod na panganganak.sana hnde sariling kati nyo lang ang iniintindi kundi matutu kayo magkontrol sa sarili nyo or ikiskis sa pader at ng mahimasmasan.kya hnde ako nag asawa at ayaw ko ung feeling na ginagawang parausan ang babae."
It all seems the product of non-existent sexual education (due mostly because of religion and believes) and a problem with laws concerning sexual matters such as the age of consent or the ban on abortion.
"When the abortionist says ‚ÄúMoneyyy‚Äù <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=14m50s"">14:50</a> üò≠üòÇ"
This poor 11 year old girl thinks she sinned for having a miscarriage and believes she caused it. This is heartbreaking. And WHY is her boyfriend 22?!?
This is so sad and so sick!! People and their perversions!! How disgusting. üíî‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üôè
These women need to be educated
This honestly disgusts me..What a cruel world.I hope the world should just end......
"Just stop reproducing already would ya, philippines ?"

I don&#39;t think so that this kind of situation between teenage girl and older guy are already exist in the Philippines?...Thank God that some of the Filipinos now are educated...
In the heat of the night...
As a Filipino i can only assure that our people will not going to get extinct.....üò¨üò∂
"Honestly These churches or so called &quot;house of god&quot; are purposely trying to make all citizens ignorant and stupid,And because of that the lives of those citizens affected are sure to be poor.And since their lives are poor their instinct will be to go to the church and attend masses hoping to get better lives.Which means more income for the so called Bishops."
Her boyfriend is older than my mom
I am beyond furious. The church is so hypocritical just like the pro-lifers.
üòîüòîüòî sad but true ...
Baby factory better than &quot; Killing babies &quot;.
Pretty sure this is a rape crisis...
"They need to educate the men and punish the pedophiles, or nothing will ever change."
"This kinda seems like rape is more of the issue, not just teen pregnancy"
I don&#39;t like it when it&#39;s always boring people going to Asia or Africa or the Middle East talking about all the negative s*** in third world countries which I don&#39;t even like using that language but they don&#39;t talk about s*** going on in European countries like racism teen pregnancy incest I mean trouble is all over the world so why the f*** are they just focusing on other countries and oh I forgot when foreign countries do focus on people in their countries always the minorities in that country&#39;s they talked down upon our put a light to
"Ok,but all these girls are so pretty. Like no joke really pretty‚ù§Ô∏è"
Legal age of consent 12.babies having babiesüòØ
"that abortionist believes she is committing a murder but still does it for money, she makes me sick."
"The Catholic chruch, they allow animal abuse, the richest church in the world and yet the people are always the poorest"
So sad &amp; horrible that &quot;man&quot; passed the age of 12 for sexual consent. Bodies aren&#39;t even fully developed &amp; minds aren&#39;t either. Just pedophiles to me.
I&#39;m a filipina...i&#39;m surprised this is happening more often than i thought
Oh my god.. without proper education that‚Äôs what happened.. 12 years old.. where‚Äôs the parents of the child.
chinese garter? in jamiaca we call it chinese skip
I use to play that game when I was little with my  friends.
Honestly I just want to know what‚Äôs up with that one lady‚Äôs eyebrows üòÇ
Throw wicked men in the fire. They are destroying the earth! Disgusting. Getting little girls pregnant with no intention to care for those lives! A similar thing happened to me. Unforgiveable!!!!!
All over the world white people put down any society where young people have babies YET HERE IN AMERICA WHEN YOUNG WHITE GIRLS GET PREGNANT THEY MAKE A TELEVISION SHOW OUT OF IT AND PAY THEM PER EPISODE AND AKE IT SEEM AS IF IT IS OK TO BE 16 AND PREGNANT OR A TEEN MOM
"They just need to provide condoms in schools, like in bathrooms and also pamphlets and stuff to teach the girls about the risks at a young age"
The Philippines is not worth dying for.
More worst than our kenyan life
I don&#39;t know what the government sees!!  <br>The world is so strange!!
"Leadership is the problem here. Such simple minds. Let&#39;s call this what it is. Children being rap<br>ed, and having children. So sad."
I guess we believed too much in our religion (catholic) that we turned a blind eye on the truth. We got blindsided by the pretty words about salvation and whatnot and about how every life is precious. Life is precious it is. But you should think about your future and your child too.
Now I understand that is why most Philippines I meet they do have 3 kids but they are not look like at all. Now I understand
These teens need more recreational activities.
Sometimes i do not understand why make so many babies when u cannot give your children  a good life.üëøüëøüëøüëøüëøüëøüëø
Men are the root of all evel.  ... Where is it right for a grown man to sleep with a child?
<b>This is terrible</b> üò≠
Ako bata din ako nag asawa 16 LNG bago mag 18 may baby boy n ko after 5 years nasundan ng girl. After non nag hiwalay n kami ng asawa q. Pero d q na naisip mag asawa at mag anak pa mas inisip q pano ko ibibigay s mga anak ko mga gusto nila.
The church wants the people to remain poor and ignorant
I feel like such a young age of consent is purely because the government know they have little control over the people and wish to be lazy. So have made a law that means they don&#39;t need to bother with paedophilies.. Forgetting those who are effected are the most vunerable.
I live here in the philippines and sometimes it was the girls fault. But sometimes they were forced to do sx to have something to eat. And now we need to change the people here. On the news I always see about rapped and they&#39;re blaming us wearing short clothes but that&#39;s not our problem! We need to change this country!
it&#39;s a shame these girls are victims  of a criminal situation
"Yep, asia... not even in China do they have sexual education at schools. Hopefully with the new sexual education going on in schools...the Philippines will not have the same problems of teenage pregnancies."
Probably Child Trafficking or Just Pedophilia.  ((I live in the Philippines))
Stupid politicians. Too much power. Concent age in a poor country. Should be higher. 12 year old baby having babies by older men. Poverty.  Stupid idea
This does not seem like teen pregnancy issue more like sexual assault and child pedophilia.
marurupok kasi
Kasalanan yan ng pamilya at lipunanüò°
Reeeee
Hopefully Duterte is ending this.
So breaking heart life so sad in those places so dirty and poor
the suffering of children once again....

The first girl isn&#39;t in love. She&#39;s manipulated.
Their babies are adorable üòç keep your head high baby girl a child is not the end of the world
"to explain things<br>- ph government don&#39;t prioritize teen pregnancy<br>- if you give attention to the interviews the girls sounded like they&#39;re forced to have sexual intercourse<br>- since some of them r not well educated they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing<br>- filipinos don&#39;t think that babies r burdens, we believe that its a gift from god that we need to treasure<br>- contraceptive r not that easy to buy and come on how can a teen afford it?"
I wonder how mamy men were actually arrested for making the child and aboning it?
I believe its criminal to have kids when d individual could barely feed themselves!!!! Soooo wrong!!!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
"Far too many of these girls are falling into the trap of abusive men. They need to be taught to be leery of any man that wants them to have a baby. All throughout the world that is a tactic of coercion and control. Once she has a child she is easier to control, the love for her child makes the child a perfect weapon to control the mother. At such a young age once she has a baby she is in a position where she has to depend on him &amp; therefore easier to control."
The US has 3x the population of the Philippines and gains around 2m every year. Philippines is like 3m every year
Her boyfriend is an ugly loser who can&#39;t get a girl his own age.
What a mess
"everysingle person in this video is fuckdup, fuckdup differently."
"It‚Äôs sad to see the poverties in those isolated shanty towns when literally in Manila /BGC and Makati u see traffic jams of Ferrari‚Äôs, Lamborghini and g wagons ... and the cleans streets and expensive high end defined stores every where.

The age of consent is 18. Who said it was 12?
11wtf??üò©üò≠üò≠
10/10 the catholic church is to be blamed lol to people that are trying to defend the church  lmao i dont have anything yo say to you just one word &#39;DISGUSTING!&#39;

All o can think of is war is coming fighting for food and resources
IN CANADA WE HAVE SUSPICIOUS PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION ILLEGALLY GIVING ULCER MEDICATION TO KILL UNSUSPECTING WOMEN&#39;S FETUSES IS SUSPECTED BUT SEEMS TO BE  COVERED UP ??????????????IT APPEARS MUCH DARK MAGIC ACTIVITY IN CANADA??
Disgusting pedophiles
"My little bro just turned 18 and I told him to not be ashamed in buying condoms and even recommended him the places where I buy mines, I know sooner or later his girlfriend and him will do the thing."
DEATH TO THIS WRETCHED COUNTRY
The girl said she was forced to &quot;napilitan ako&quot;. She didn&#39;t say she wanted to. It was rape not consent.
Perfect place for old American pervs.
"So this is what the pro-lifers want. Banning abortions DOES NOT stop them, it makes them dangerous and increasingly life threatening for women."
"This is the craziest YT video I&#39;ve seen. But, but, at these these little girls aren&#39;t being stoned to death as in other countries still a tragedy though."
They are legal age at 12 but have to be 18 for birth control.. that&#39;s a severe issue..
very good that someone calls out the criminal catholic church!
"I am watching from the Philippines and it&#39;s ironic that the ads playing are for a politician running for senator. It&#39;s election on May 13. Vote wisely, kababayans"

"We must teach them the error of their ways.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Mr. president, drop the bombs!"
this is not fair on the children
"One. Why Is America dealing with the Philippines? It&#39;s the governments choice to deal with that. I know I&#39;m getting defensive over my country but since when was it there deal to deal with? Let them DEAL WITH IT THEMSELVES.<br>Two. If the teenagers get pregnant WITH CONSENT there&#39;s no need to interview them for seeing if it was non consensual. If it was non consensual yes, tell the police. .<br><br>Three. Again I know I know I&#39;m getting defensive but still if it was your country you get just as defensive as me."
"It blows my mind that a country would fight so hard against birth control...as they are being flooded with newborns whose parents are also children and incapable of caring for the baby. It&#39;s a vicious cycle that leads to nothing but poverty and angst. And these &quot;men&quot; who sleep with children are disgusting. And just like in the US, they go on to keep having more and more babies with more and more girls. Vicious cycle. If it&#39;s always about the children, why would they condemn these babies to lives of poverty and poor care? No abortions are available, yet you can&#39;t provide birth control to kids so they don&#39;t have kids? Make that make sense to anyone. These pregnant girls are the ones who suffer by being forced to have children they are incapable of taking care of. Ridiculous. If people are SO against birth control and abortion, they should step up and adopt these newborns so they can give them the lives they say they&#39;re entitled to. Either be part of the solution or shut up."
"All these comments saying Birth Control is 100% the answer are wrong.

The male mayor says women shouldn‚Äôt be able to make decisions on when to have kids and when told about the teen pregnancy crisis his only answer is ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù. The female doctor who sees the abortions and death every day is the one who says young ones should be educated and have options. She the educated one so why are our government leaders like that mayor?
Kudos to Al Jazeera for this documentary.
"Can we talk about how gorgeous the girls at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=22m22s"">22:22</a> are"
"Educating the women is great...but also educating these men who THINK it&#39;s okay to impregnate these young girls is critical! Seriously, what kind of nonsense is it that 12 is the age of consent???!!! Education to BOTH sides of the parties is so important. If the Catholic religion is so adamant on abstinence...then the men should control their urges...or if they are, as the video calls &quot;weak&quot;, then these men should not be able to approach young vulnerable girls."
<b>MGA POKPOK</b>
"Why are men making the decisions for the females, honestly smh. And religion shouldn&#39;t affect politics"
gov&#39;t. rules and religion...age of consent is 12 yrs....that is outrageous and criminal...OMG...children having babies...horrific!
Is condom considered as contraception?
"This is misleading. I am a Filipina. The  legal age of consent  is 18.  You cannot marry  when you are below 18 years old. The respective parents of both Groom and Bride  must sign the  Marriage  Certificate for it to be binding. I got married  at  25 and that&#39;s the time when one can marry  without  parent&#39;s consent. These women who gave birth at a very young age are mostly street children.. they have irresponsible if not  drug addict parents. They have uneducated parents who didn&#39;t care about the future of their  children. AGAIN, THE LEGAL AGE OF CONSENT  IN THE PHILIPPINES  IS  18.  EIGHTEEN  YEARS  OLD."
babae na tayo.
You need to raise the age of consent!!
"I think abortion should be legal.Wake up people who,I think those children who couldn&#39;t barely eat or go to school are already suffering.They don&#39;t deserve that and it might come to the point that even them don&#39;t want to live anymore."
Has God abandoned the Philippines????
wow am a pinoy unfortunately my sister and I want to adopt because we don&#39;t have children. leave them alone okey?
i live here in the philippines is a beautiful country but some people are living perfectly fine but some just wanted to do it thats why that happens and they are always blaming the government
God bless and thinks god
Kids should be educated that sexual union of female and male will produce a child-into poverty. Plain and simple.
"This happens in every country all over the world, only in different forms.."
"When you take the Catholic out of everything , you get peace and harmony. Birth control is a basic human right."
Im filipino.<br>And it is not normal
May GOD BLESS U WITH HAPPY JAI HANUMANüòéüòé
"...and yet, so many flips be like &quot;proud to be filipino&quot; ü§£"
I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant hello! You didn‚Äôt have your period for one month then your pregnant these girls need more education
The government should make illegal for age of consent at 18 why 12 that‚Äôs not even old enough to get a job? That‚Äôs one of the reasons the Philippines is corrupt
I wish they had added subtitles instead of subbing over the Tagalog
"its simple if you cant afford then dont buy into it, if you cant afford to raise a baby then dont have one"
I THINK its more ethical to abort than to let live a child who will suffer under poverty
So these young women are being statutory raped and no one does anything? It‚Äôs going to take more than practicing abstinence to solve this. They need to raise the legal age of consent.
"It&#39;s a matter of choice. Even young people knows what is right or wrong.  Before getting into something, we must foresee the outcome. But I guess we cannot blame these kids, maybe because of their state of life or was force etc.. All I can say is they are brave enough to handle their situation. <br><br>I am lazy person that&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to have a family at early age. I am not fun of kitchen stuffüòÇ, so just trying my best to achieve my goal first to have stable job and can hire someone to help me in kitchen bla bla... when I have my own family.üòÅ ‚úå"
I wonder by how much we could increase the average IQ on Earth if all religious people were sent to Mars.
And then half the men leave. There are some serious cultural issues here. Like the country is in a state of emotional disconnect with itself.

The Roman Catholic church is one of the reason why our country is poor. It is manipulative and is making our politicians do their well and if they are not given an amount of money they will never shut up and keeps on bullying the government. Lately we have Duterty and the Roman Catholic church hates it because they could not do the bad things they does like before. But the Roman Catholic church manage to make its members believe them and act irresponsibly.
retarded country.
WTF 12?
Sad
That is not a teen it‚Äôs a child for god sakes :(
free desexing services?
My older brother got his girlfriend pregnant at 15 and him 15 as well he had to beg my dad and even kneeled down and had to take in a lot of criticism from the neighbors but now everything is good he is an engineer now and he supports his family and they are all happy.
This is mere propaganda to make the murder of innocent babies legal. DISGUSTING!
"Why does no one educate them males predator? Males are really horrible by Nature, to me. No one has ever heard a story where a woman has violated a boy. For, in the end, is accepted. This is pure mess."
"The real problem is the fact that many, especially the less fortunate, don‚Äôt know about anti-sexual harassment laws, which are enforced quite strictly around here. As demonstrated in the video, there are many places where rape and other forms of similar assault are justified as shows of power in honor of the traditional patriarchy that they are familiar with or even equal transactions for food or other basic necessities, as seen with the young girl and the twenty-two year old man‚Äîshe‚Äôs being fed by the man‚Äôs family. <br><br>Basically, no matter how strict the government may be, if the victims themselves don‚Äôt know they‚Äôve been or are being assaulted, they‚Äôll never be brought justice simply because they can‚Äôt and/or won‚Äôt report it‚Äîwhich is what the video missed. <br><br>In simpler words, they need to be educated, to go to school, but they choose not to due to their position‚Äîone would naturally prioritize the need for food on the table before all else to survive‚Äîand so continue to make the situation worse. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle."
Im a filipino and yet i‚Äôm shocked about the other side of life in my country üò±
lack of education nakakainis dat pinag tutuunan ng gobyerno kahit na maliliit lang na sektor ng lipunan
Those Filipina&#39;s know what they doing. Dont let em fool you just cause they talk like a mouse and look all innocent. They like tigers
"Abstinence just isn&#39;t a realistic idea. The whole problem is lack of education and religion. Its just painful to watch, this is only going to get worse."
"How about the responsible authorities (related personel like doctors, specialist or officers from ministry of education) carry out awareness campaign  by going to villages like happyland and give exposure to the youth there and in the same time provide some knowledge regarding this serious topic?"
"This is an eye opener. Pag kinakati ang fefe at itit ikaskas na lang sa pader... hahahaha. Seriously, hindi lang ang mga anak o bata ang kawawa. Pati na din ang mga young parents. Kaya dumarami ang male &amp; female prostitutes dahil sa ganitong sitwasyon na walang ipakain sa mga anak nila.."
And I thought my country had problems.
I lived in the Philippines for 16 years and even I am surprise that 12 is the legal age of consent!
I use to have a boyfriend whenni was 12 and he was 25 years old i fell in love with him if i didn&#39;t know he cheated on me i would have been pregnant with his child and he would have left me once i got pregnant
"In Indonesia still some Muslim conservative ban contraception, because it is same way to kill fetus. What happen in Phillipine relate in Indonesia"
Age of consent is 12? I think that&#39;s wrong information... Legal age here is 18.. not 12
"In philippines, women give birth yearly.. Even after a 3 months of giving birth, some get pregnant againüòÄ"
Just know how to spray and walk away. What a stand-up guy. Keep it up!
"The government don&#39;t give much attention with the poverty here in Philippines, even the statistic report of poor people they only report 1% out of 100 not accurate. Children of these ages don&#39;t have guidance with the parents because of poverty and no proper learning."
You guys sure it‚Äôs a pregnancy problem? It sounds like a sexual assault problem...
Those girls have no chance. The Catholic Church has them in a prison
"Are there any addresses for these families in need?  I don&#39;t have much, but I would like to send them a box from US.  Especially the mothers with lots of kids.  I would really appreciate it."
For sure I would not want to be one of the girls that live there
Ban all types of religion. That will solve many of humankind&#39;s problems
I‚Äôm pregnant at 18 so I‚Äôm not even gonna say nothing but I‚Äôm feel sorry for the kids under 16 child birth ain‚Äôt no easy pain trust me and loosing a child is just painful üòî
"Consent at 12, do the girls really know what consent are they giving? Or is that really a consent?"
Stupid country.
So why isn&#39;t the bf charged with rape?  I thought their laws were so strict there.
"Politicians are messed up all over the world. So, that governor sees no problem in such a low consent age (12) but vehemently discourages use of contraceptives? Why not increase the consent age to over 19 when the young girls are legally permitted to use contraceptives? The world is a massive, massive mess!"
"The people who just believe in abstinence just don&#39;t get that not all people will understand that their life could be ruined by a night in the bed. Filipinos are hard headed, it&#39;s rude but true. We are very hard headed, and I admit, even I."
Y&#39;all have no idea honestly
Catholic church saying no to contraceptive use..  but they don&#39;t help this children.. they give talks in schools!!! Yes on schools but private schools... How about public school who really needs your advices and talks. How bullshit... I Believe in God but Catholic church&#39;s leaders no!!
I cannot believe how effed up this is X(
feels like normal in ph
Im going to start chopping mens dicks off with alien technology
this governor is trash
She is really beautiful.
It is sad that the government of some countries do not care enough about their pour to work faster in the rights of young people and their families.
"Lord, why do they not take more time keep their communities free of poverty and diseases, and not making their communities sexual social factories. What is happening in the Philippines is something that has been happening in pour communities around the world. It would be so wonderful if the men of the government of the Philippines would step in and encourage these men to learn trades that are provided by the government and make it illegal for a man to have more than one wife not even a mistress if that young lady is underage."
The poverty of Asian country and African countries is heart braking.
I beg to this agree dont ruin my whole country with your small area research some stupid filipino are doing like that stupidity but the legal age in the Philippines  is 18 yrs old and even your 25 yrs if going to be marry is still need a parental consent...that filipino is those lazy filipino who wasting their life of doing nothing....i hate this report ur aljazeera is baseless just 10 of 100
once again religion is behind the failures of the people!
Is this what christian teach?
Why her brows like that
One more thing for me to pray for each night üòû
ang bata mu pa para magbuntis. tapos ang pogi pa ng syota mu :D
"I am currently living in the Philippines i got pregnant @ the age of 18 now i&#39;m 27 with only one child, taking contraceptives is really a big help.I am continuing my studies hopefully i will be a degree holder nxtyr!"
So is a married man committing adultery not a sin?? Is fornicating okay to their belief but using contraceptive a sin?? They should read the Bible on their own instead of just hearing from the Priest. I mean those 30 plus years old married men sleeping around with girls need to be jailed. But maybe to them adultery and fornicating is not sin as compared to using contraceptive.
I like how she threw in &quot;high from sniffing pine solvent&quot;

The church should not own the government. Imposing your personal moral beliefs and all their consequences on the general public is a violation and a shame.
"The laws need to be changed, 12 is not an acceptable age. It has to be changed"
"&quot;One less mouth to feed&quot;? You could&#39;ve said it in a less disrespectful way. You don&#39;t know how hard it is to live here if you don&#39;t have any money and you make it sound like the parents are just waiting and always ready to throw their kids away to some guy who impregnated them. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the docu is good and all but pls choose your words wisely. You could&#39;ve said &quot;the guy can help with their food expenses&quot; or end it with the &quot; the girl don&#39;t like to press charges bec she&#39;s inlove with him&quot;."
Its more fun in the philippines traffic lack of infrastructure filipino going abroad slow internet lots of grabage high crime rate lack of family planning.
How can you sleep at night knowing you killed a fetus? üò® a life?
"This is very sad. I love my country, but I&#39;m afraid this issue will never be resolved."
What happened to 18 and 21 year old what law enforcement is this .
"I understand the movement and believe in the message of abstinence but as an organization you have to understand the realities of your culture, teenagers are being raped and are pressured into sexual relationships and if they do not control themselves then what is in place to help and provide needed support? Other than babies there are many diseases...the countries need to come up with real solutions and men who are preying on the young should get professional help and should be severely penalized."
"Why children&#39;s making children&#39;s? The girls should be in school. The porpulation is high they need learn to use condoms. There childhood days gone sad,"
The governor is an IDIOT!!
That‚Äôs what catholicism done to us for more than 500 years
Soo faithful yet soo unfaithful at the same time
What a big stupidity of the Catholic church to prefer to see hungry and starving kids than give those poor girls contraceptives to prevent that happen ahhh <br>double standard double moral
Bunch of hypocrites says lots of negativity comments of our own dark side of my very own country..so pathetic that they haven&#39;t been in the  philippines  yet...to witness the good things that we have...yes ..that&#39;s the other part stories of our country but its not nationwide problem ..must of a young teen age pregnant  and poverty can seen inside the urban area like manila which are very common... inside squater places... yet aside from that stories we  are still the happiest person...that full of hopes!   Shame to  those western and other countrys whose spoke so highly as if there&#39;s nothing wrong the way how you lived... in every country there&#39;s advantages and so disadvantages...its just the matter of your perspectives...no wonder in some areas in western got the highest number of suicidal case... becouse of your perfect nation that you guys had..
poor school kids with that freak of a singer dude. Ugh. Like adding fuel to the fire.
I am blessed that I am educated on the understanding of sexual relationships. I am also sad that some people do not agree in PPHood so sad
The Girl Said Philippnes Is Ugly In REALITY i hate that plz do not make FUN OF USSS

If you have no choice contraception does that mean you have to give birth again and again and again then or what
"I&#39;m from Philippines, but mostly this cases happen in a shanty town or squatter area. Government is trying to relocate them to a better houses but some of them is  just accepting the new house and sell it to have money then go back to squatter area again.<br>Sometimes being pregnant at such a young age is because of irresponsibility of both parents and kids. <br>If u are poor just study hard instead of having a boyfriend for such a young age the saddest part here is the parents they don&#39;t seem to take care the whereabouts of their kids. Education is the key to get away from Poverty. But they choose to stay having a hard living &amp; being uneducated. üòî"
"&quot;I do not believe that just because you&#39;re opposed to abortion that that makes you pro-life. In fact, I think in many cases, your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child educated, not a child housed. And why would I think that you don&#39;t? Because you don&#39;t want any tax money to go there. That&#39;s not pro-life. That&#39;s pro-birth. We need a much broader conversation on what the morality of pro-life is.&quot;<br><br><br>- Sister Joan Chittister, O.S.B."

These documentaries show that education is important
"That 38 year old man, first of all, he had a wife but he still went and date a young girl aged similar to his first child like what the fudge man."

Disgusting
wtf 13 and 22 thats not ok wtf
that woman is stupid then how ?????
Too many children in that  country.
How are these grown men talking to young girls in the first place? When I was 11-15 I had very little contact with adult males. Family members and teachers were just about the only grown men I was around. How are all these girls exposed to grown men enough to date them and have kids?
"The Philippines are (unfortuntely) well-know for its high level of poverty, prostitution (obviously due to poverty) and religious impact. <br>The rise of baby is a DIRECT CONSEQUENCE of these 3 things combined; NOT the &quot;legal age of consent : 12&quot;"
Reason why religion is a cancer to the society
Because og poverty. Sino ba gustong tumulong sa mga taong nangangalangan? Sama ako. Hindi ako mayaman pero gusto kung maka tulong hindi sa usaping pera kundi sa supporta at education.
"I hope that someone from Al Jazeera read this: Please censor the faces of the young children in this video. They are innocent. Even the faces of criminals are censored on news channels.

"Govt cajole these youth  but if you are an OFW Overseas Filipino Worker the govt treat you like garbage, they refuse to give or renew your passport because u r not meant to marry and divorce  abroad unless you get an annulment an equivalent to divorce in PI. Divorce takes about 6 months in Europe but in the Philippines it takes about 10 yrs. Even if u r old at 70 and know you have some pension they will take that money away to pay for the case. At 70 they think u r going to marry again? (I scratch my head with my middle finger!) Everyone is corrupt! They refuse to honour and recognise a divorce certificate from the highest court of justice with her majesty&quot;s crown  sealed on the document of decree nisi absolute. Within that 10 years the lawyer/Atty demands P8,000 per court attendance on top of P300,000. first payment. So you need to sell anything valuable to pay the fee then what, live in the street or squat? Without getting your divorce in Europe adjudicated in PI your consequent marriage is called &quot;legal bigamy&quot; , (it doesn&#39;t exist in an English dictionary) the second marriage therefore is Null and Void automatically, there should be no legal proceedings to go through but the certificate be stamped Null and Void by the appropriate govt offices like NSO/PSA, local authority where the marriage occurred etc. These youngsters are an asset of any would be politician who needed millions of votes; the more desperate young or old the better. So baby factory will carry on."

All children are born sacred.... the forgotten knowledge*
There should be no contraceptives but there shld be education for all
I think i&#39;d rather have the side effects of the birth control pills than having more and more children in poverty. This is so sad.
oh my goodness is that the place called payatas? i never thought that thats the kind of life they have. hope that the government will give them a better place to live. not in that smokey mountain.
"The comment section in this video is a mess so here‚Äôs some info I gathered:<br>1. The age of consent in the Philippines is 12 years old.<br>2. People need to be educated about contraceptives. I‚Äôve read articles on birth control pill myths and it is nauseating. Contraceptives comes in different forms. <br>3. Religion does play a huge part on this.<br>4. You can‚Äôt just point your finger at one problem and say it‚Äôs the cause of poverty in the Philippines. There are tons more. You can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs just the lack of education. But that‚Äôs defined a good start. <br> 4.2 Child support is practically nonexistent. <br> 4.3 Educating people just a tiny bit more could impact and break this poverty chain. What‚Äôs the purpose of knowing how the world was 500 years ago when you‚Äôre completely blinded in the world we live in now? The majority of people are unaware that the age of consent in the Philippines is 12, that shows exactly how blinded we are<br>5. At the end of the day change will start with the people."
"What??? I cant believe what I&#39;m seeing and hearing!! Oh how awful this is, pregnant at 11?? People dont realize how bad some people have to live!! Side effects of birth control? Yea a side effect that is forever ( a child !!) Oh no birth control but age of consent is 12??!!! Wtf!!"
This is sad.... both the church &amp; govt are to be blamed. Stone age church practices + corrupt govt = 3rd world country.
I guess it‚Äôs easy there to keep reproduce even as single mothers they look as if the entire village helps each other out with survival including childcare they all don‚Äôt have to work about 3-4 jobs in order to survive -pay any bills and put food on the table .

I donot understand if they r Catholics they should not sleep before getting married are family not teaching moral values it will always be a woman who has to endure pain I think they should have seminars men r taking advantage of vulnerable girls what a shame
Ah yes Philippines. A land so beautiful but destroyed by her own people.
This happens when you&#39;re ignorant
"Corruption is not only the factor that caused poverty in the Philippines, but also overpopulation."
"There is a mess up in this video because the legal age in the philippines is 18 for the government, in fact the male can be imprisoned by doing these. In the case of the catholic church the legal age is 25. These people shown in the video are people who came mostly from a broken family and from poverty. I also read some comment about how many people from the Philippines could remain a virgin at the age 20. Id say alot specially to our extremely religious people and our highlanders who value being a virgin untill they get married."
Separate church and government üò°üò°üò°
I been watching video like those all day i can belive that those this are happening in other country am so sad for those girl it hurts
12 years old is a child!! How sick can you get?!
More sexual education And contraceptives. These things will come over time hopefully sooner than later.
What is Chinese garter
The profound ignorance is truly amazing! Exacerbated by the stupidity of the Catholic Church and it&#39;s amazing ignorance.
I have a feeling this country is a haven for pedophiles....disgusting
"A lot of the comments are saying that 12 is the age of consent, but it is according to Republic act 8353 (1997 Anti-Rape Law)<br>However, I read news of them considering change from 12 years old to around 16. No permanent change has been made legally yet unfortunately.<br>To see some form of minor change in this country, this may be a good place to start."

"That boy was amazing, so wise! He stood firm in that teens should be abstinate because of their immaturity and not understanding fully the repercussions. But was wise enough to say: I believe in contraception, because not everyone is strong enough to control themselves. Yes, kid!"

blame the bantay bata 101. they will imprison you if you try to discipline your own children in the philippines. thats why children gets pregnant at early age
"The Catholic Church, is the Taliban of the West."
"So young to have kids..  Im 42, and still single and no kids..  Kalokah.   Atleast im enjoying my life"
as a teenager from the Philippines. stereotypes about contraceptives is common and the access to contraceptives is hard due to the age requirement. a lot of females here don&#39;t use contraceptive due to their &quot;religious beliefs&quot;.
"This stupid woman is talking about how young pregnancy is costing the economy, while people shouldn&#39;t have to live in trash and garbage. <br>It&#39;s the government&#39;s fault that these peo are living like this."
was it just me or that girl looked like Kathryn Bernardo ?? omg shes so beautiful .
How tf is it costing the government a lot and they barely living under a real roof
If the government cant do anything at least should give them sexual education like this kids dont even know about consent they are kids
"Filipinos have no discipline, it‚Äôs not the government‚Äôs fault!"
"I&#39;m a Filipino and watching this makes me feel sad. When I was 12 years old, I am still playing tumbang preso."

I‚Äôm from the uk. I lost my virginity at 13. To a 26 yr old Greek barman on holiday. It was amazing.
I think they need a revolutionary movement in Filipino against child marriage and rape. And introduce 18 years policy for girl marriage.
When mother Mary got married to joseph she was 12 years old.for those who don&#39;t know.

I&quot;m an 11 week old fetus and just got pregnant.

Im filipino i didnt know the legal age of consent is 12. wtf
you dont miscarry at 7 months. you deliver a baby that stillborn.
age of consent here in ph is 18..not 12.if my 16year old daughters bf got her pregnant i can sue him for rape cause shes a minor.
Ugh I remember sitting through meetings like that as a teen. üôÑ
America ang Philippines almost the same....
Kinda scared to move to the Philippines now
"How can we adopt these children and import them into America? Why isn&#39;t the Catholic church (or some other charity) doing that? In NYC where I live there are literally thousands of wealthy women who either can&#39;t conceive or don&#39;t want to give birth to their own children, but would adopt/ buy a child if possible. I think our laws are corrupt to forbid paying for adoptions, bc it would have a net positive impact on the world. Here we have wealthy, older established women and couples crying bc they want babies, and yet on the other side of the world in Philippines live these babies that are unwanted :("
Of course he disagrees he is part of the Master Plan engineered by the same frauds in Rome that would rather people avoid contraception in these poor countries and then have to live in Squalor; sure he disagrees and has done nothing but feed the deluded wafers and wine and then leave the rest up to God. And the Philippines are not alone in this tragedy.
This place would be heaven for R. Kelly
I don&#39;t have the words. I really don&#39;t.
Is this topic is about Philippines factories sorry wrong channel...
I‚Äôm a Filipino myself and I never knew about this problem... I feel so ignorant. I wonder what other crisis my country is facing that I don‚Äôt know about.
"the world needs jehovah and his son jesus christ , both men and women need to be directed by God."
"admit it or not, Philippines is not the only country that have this BIG problem"
"Its actually 18. Its stated in the philippine constitution..<br>But.<br>In the slums, its prolly they dont care about that or dont know about it since they dont have access to education, and even if they had, the prefer earning few pennies in collecting garbage or begging in the streets. <br>In there, i think as long as the boy has a means to do a living and the girl likes him, instant elope. :/"
I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t seem to get over this NGO&#39;s rep&#39;s eyebrows. It&#39;s like inverted coma. Lol
That is not about problems in the Philippines that is good.. <br>Because they want a baby and at least they not kill the baby because that is very important to the Philippines... üòíüôÑ and Philippines is not saying about money with you because Philippines say I don&#39;t need money its only love and cares at least God is always supporting.. for usüòíüôÑ
"So, he wants women to have no rights.  Illiterate,  barefoot and pregnant, poor or not.  He is part of problem, not solution.  I don&#39;t know about the country. I will zip it."
Why don t they give these girls a pregancy shot every three months to decline these unwanted pregancies. And teach these girls about sexual education in school.
"I&#39;m an American who lives in the Philippines. Palawan is strange in that it&#39;s such a beautiful paradise, but there is so much poverty there. One needs to understand the culture here. They are very religious here, mostly Catholic. Also, they are very family oriented. Even desperately poor families consider a baby to be a major blessing. I have found that most pinay are incredibly caring and loving mothers. They really love their children. I really don&#39;t know what else to say...it&#39;s going to be really hard to change things here."
Western people are so good at uncovering dirts from other countries but not their own...
Focusing on contraception campaign is misguided... focus on raising the age of consent and criminalizing the predatory behavior of sexing 12 and 14 year old girls!
i dont want to live in this planet anymore
12!!!
education is really important. :(

Get them on Birth Control
"Geez, the Abrahamic traditions have ruined the world."
Disgusting
In what crazy world do people think a 12 year old can give consent
"Education  is the answer for this. There is no program for teen contraception in the Philippines, there is no need to anywhere in the world. I would blame this to the parents, they should instill in their children&#39;s mind to be a DREAMER and should set a certain standard of what they want their lives should be in the future. People with dreams has the tendency of self preservation .  I am a Filipina, but that stuff never dawned into me, why? Because I was and is still a dreamer.  I am Catholic but now that I am married I use contraception. It is easier for the church to go against it because they don&#39;t provide for the families needs.   Also there is a belief in the Philippines that contraception has ill side effects for your health. Here&#39;s my 5 cents for that, western countries use contraception but they have longer lifespans than their Filipino counterparts."
"The witch-looking foreign woman thinks the solution is to create a huge population of prison inmates.  Instead of her penal celibacy, what they all need is education (not their narrow interpretation, teaching baby-aversion, but actual life skills and knowledge) and vision.  Go teach that in the slums; don&#39;t wait for them to come to school.  Babies are labor-intensive, but they are assets, not liabilities.  I don&#39;t care how poor, any country that can mobilize its surplus of human capital will become a world leader."

Wtf is 12 years old legal age? Fake news. Fraud. Legal age here is 18.
Separation of church and republic.
So you can consent but can‚Äôt get birth control or std testing.. ok.
"As a filipino myself, i dont think most of their laws r good for others. I also dont think the Carholic church teaches the right thing. In my perspective, abortion shouldnt be legal anywhere. A lot of people want to adopt babies, children, and teens. I know some people that waited a long time to adopt a baby. The baby hasnt even gotten to take their first breath. Why end their life? It is their responsibility to take care of the baby, if they cant let someone that can take care of them. They made the baby, before they make the baby they should think of what they r about to do. If they do abortion cause they dont want people to judge them or they r scared of their parents they should nt make a baby. Their should be better laws of when people can have babies. Parents should be more strict and careful not letting their children do whatever they want. Parents shouldnt be forcing their child to have a baby or marry someone rich because they r poor. Its not their childrens fault that they r poor. Children and teens shouldnt be out doing what their not supposed to do, they r supposed to be educated and hanging out with friends. I hope one day someone will change this whole world around and they can only do that with God. With God all things r possible, if u dont want to believe me or if u get mad at me because im not getting mad at u for believing what i believe i want to encourage u to do what is right. Ik we cant always do what is right because we r all sinners we r human beings."
I didn&#39;t even start my period at 11 imagine being pregnant üôÅ
Abortion is illegal.....huh.
age of consent is 12? B R U H
If the Catholic Church wont fork up the cash to pay for all these children then they definitely SHOULD NOT have any say when it comes to womens choice of contraceptive use.
condoms anyone ?

"How about giving these unwanted children on adoption to willing parents from other countries. N what&#39;s wrong with their law.  How can a men just leave a girl or women after getting them pregnant.  Its rape.  How about marriage,  they don&#39;t have this institution or what."

"Karl Marx was right, religion really is the &quot;opiate of the people.&quot; In the Philippines, it is the kind of opiate that tells them to hyper propagate and keep them in poverty.  If the Filipino population finally decides to remove it&#39;s Catholic influence then real progress can be made about the population crisis and the poverty that it&#39;s nation suffers."

That is the problem in my country many poor people will have young couple then if they will have early children they will live in the street and all the blame is in the government wtf thinking here in the Philippines.

Thankfully my mom had a boyfriend when she was finishing college (btw i&#39;m a filipino) and my dad was a Navy
That&#39;s why the Philippines is still a third world country.
SHAME. Always in the woman&#39;s hands...the baby...Men leave. The Church makes rules yet does not help...SHAME

It&#39;s called patriarchal masogyny these girls and women don&#39;t have rights. They&#39;re stripped away as soon as a man controls her. So f*cking sad and horrible for these children.
"Why against abortion when those who are against it are not even helping them. Increasing poverty. Also no to abortion because it is life but when the child is born, life is not even beautiful for them."
Gross
A lot of those young girls sell there bodys for money to buy food and a lot of people go to there country to buy these kids

"I&#39;ve tried to watch this documentary and I just can&#39;t. It&#39;s too painful.

"I am sorry, what? I didn&#39;t like the phrasing of any of this so I couldn&#39;t even watch the rest. These are children.

This pedophile isn&#39;t in any way, shape, or form a &quot;boyfriend.&quot; I am surprised at Al Jazeera English for putting something as exploitative and click-hungry as this together. They&#39;re usually great about giving informative, thought out pieces. This is also insulting to the Philippines as they are hardly the only country ravaged by colonization that has these atrocities happening.  Do better, please."

Birth control is illegal because. Unplanned kids leads to poverty abortion I can understand but birth control is basically 100% effective if u do everything the doctor says. Also if someone can‚Äôt use hormonal measures there‚Äôs non hormonal measure like the copper iud. Or other barrier methods.
These woman have a right to contraceptive. No government should implement their personal religion to ruling a country. What they are doing to these woman is totally wrong.
Yeah to expensive for the government that only cares about the rich anyway their system is only for the rich so don&#39;t go whinging about the government paying for the poor!!
Why do they keep having babies if they‚Äôre living in poverty????!!! God!

"If anyone wonder why this happens and government are not totally helping this kind of problem because they won&#39;t and this isn&#39;t something the government wanted.

I‚Äôm getting totally matter is I watch this this girl gives birth to a baby and within weeks she‚Äôs pregnant Again
The Filipino government want them to continue to have kids and be poor. It keeps them trapped in the system
Honestly the best solution would probably be to have a mass  A gram of something like implanted implants or are you days when you become of age to have a period at a point in your life when you‚Äôre ready to have a child and can financially care for that child and already the implants can simply be removed. I‚Äôm also in favor of the system in the US believe it or not nothing else is going to work it‚Äôs just not. That way the children that are teenagers can finish school and have a future you don‚Äôt end up with children of Their own living in deep pottery.   These families are so poor they can‚Äôt provide medical care for these children I just watched another video where a baby died after suffering at home for days because the family had the money to treat him . I don‚Äôt understand why these parents don‚Äôt take responsibility for themselves even if they are on educated they should know that they should not have children unless they Before them.<br><br> I myself make probably 90 times but these people dead and even with that I still have decided not to have a child because I know I do not make enough money myself to give the child what I feel would be a proper life I have a home food air conditioning running water heat water tanks everything I have all the basic necessities but even with that and free schooling I still don‚Äôt feel Can I make enough to properly care for a child.
The only other way to solve this problem would literally be for people to go house to house and teach people about contraception but you‚Äôre got to understand that you‚Äôre dealing with a population that is mostly uneducated they don‚Äôt have the skills needed to understand about contraception. I‚Äôve even heard of doctors in the Philippines telling one man that his colon cancer was caused by drinking cold water after he ate these are your medical professionals good god no wonder there‚Äôs a problem. And I seriously doubt the Philippines has the means to send people door-to-door to do this kind of approach It‚Äôs sad but that‚Äôs true.
The saddest part of the &quot;happy&quot; country.  Suffer everyday. Goverment always do nothing for them. No proper education. Blaming poor for being poor. Me.. An average person.. Can&#39;t do anything about it.. I can only give meals to homeless.. But can&#39;t help a large families and people who suffer from this country.
An aids? What stops STDs?
Really hoping that Amina Evangelista Swanepoel‚Äôs points of view of what constitutes ‚Äúlaw‚Äù and ‚Äúpressing charges‚Äù is deeper than incarceration as a solution to centuries old dynamics as well as ‚Äúcultural‚Äù policies stemming from a ‚Äúcatholic tradition‚Äù cages alone never create progress... ‚Äúlaws‚Äù appear to protect the wealthy and male population... so many layers so many lives

Why is the current state of the philippines like this? this goes back centuries ago. The country does have extreme potential to be everything you imagine. advanced in you name it, but just look at our history and you will see the missing link or at least the reason why the Philippines cant reach its full potential. <br><br>and Spain, America aka everyone who colonized the Phil. refuses to acknowledge this. <br><br>think about it. look what happened to India by the British. look what happened to Africa. every country that has been colonized by the white man is a poor country because it was sucked dry by the white man. <br><br>look at japan, never once colonized or occupied...... highly advanced country. <br><br>this is the approach one should take before blaming filipinos themselves. they arent the ones to blame. its the people who control their government and everyone else who colonized them before hand.<br><br>once something is damaged you cant erase it. you have to learn from it and heal. the Philippines never got the chance to heal."

"This is a majority catholic society, disgusting how these girls are used at such a houngan age."
Wtf. Consent is only 12!? What a backward society.<br>I&#39;m gonna work for a NGO one day and repeal their govt<br><br>Child having babies. What a world we live in. Why doesn&#39;t govt do sth about it !?
"This is not right !... This issue happens everywhere. India, America, Africa, Mexico and so on... Hardship is the number one cause of this issue. I am a Filipino, born and raised. Why should these people choose the Philippines as an example ? I bet there are children at young age that are pregnant in Europe ! So why the Philippines ?"
"People say &quot; It&#39;s more fun in the Philippines.&quot;<br>And there&#39;s a documentart saying &quot; Philippines&#39;s baby factory.&quot;<br>Ew, i just lose hope in this country sometimes ( this is why we are third country- )<br>They are not all rich or &quot; may kaya lang &quot; <br>What they lacking of education, parental guidance and what&#39;s the right and wrong ( this is just my opinion, i seen many pregnant women before- )"

This is what happens when woman are robbed of basic human rights.
So you say.  Stop meddling in local affairs.
America so full of it. Cant solve our own problems. But want to solve and save everyone else problems. And this video got heavy feminist touch on it.
FINNALY SOMEONE TO KNOW WHAT PHILLIPINE SUFFERING
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=2m13s"">2:13</a> The lord WOULD NOT think of that as a sin, one she was pregnant when she was 12, 2 she didnt know!!"
This is so sad üò¢
I want to donate condoms to them
I cant believe there leader is not helping them he only want to buy weapon and so much people like him
"Yeah, this bothers me a lot but...ANGELA‚Äôs BABIES ARE SO CUUUUUUTE"
"this is what catholicism has done to the Philippines. This is what goes on in the PH when its starting to cater to wealthy politicians and celebrities. Duterte had a chance to fix this problem.  take children off the streets and put them in schools.  educate parents with condom use, and give out protections to men and women.  this is sickening."
this is really sad.
"Religious solution to teen pregnancy....   Sing songs of hope while discouraging contraception!  Essentially they do NOTHING, but cause the problem!<br><br>Science solution to teen pregnancy...  problem solved with many forms of contraception."

"I stopped at &quot;legal age of consent 12&quot;, poorly researched."
And here i am a fifteen year old Filipina girl who dont give a fck to those kinds of relationship or lifestyle üòÇ just here in my room lol
wat????
"I&#39;m 26 and still a virgin. I am not ashamed if I&#39;m like this. If other women make fun of me, I will literally say they are whores. They hurt me, I&#39;ll hurt them severely."
this should stop :(( im a filipino but im not happy about this still majority in the philippines have family planning
I don&#39;t see any legislation being supported by Catholics to convict rapists. all I see are bans on contraceptives and abortion. women‚Äôs rights are ignored.
Boyfriend nya mokhang Adic .....üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Legal age of consent is 12? What?? I&#39;m a Filipino but I&#39;ve never heard of this...
westernization. what about their local traditions !
Nag paparami ng anak ang mga pinoy kc sa paniniwalang balang araw maraming tutulong sa kanila o d naman kaya eh mag anak kana ng maaga para d kayo nagkakalayo ng edad... PUTANG INA TALAGA..
Crazy place poor infants blame the goverment. I will never ever be visiting the Philippines or promote anyone to visit the Philippines.
"So sad to say and it all adds up to lack of education starting from grass root level,"
"The catholics are the very perpetrators to this act, the only thing that matters to them is money, for each child born a fee of baptism is required otherwise that child cannot go to school etc"
"teenage pregnancy is not good, but Philippians are beautiful and lovely people, if their  population will grow it would be fine. so, go, make more babies :D"
Di Indonesia mah santai gada agama ngatur2
Inilah pentingnya kondom bagi pengentot
Wkwkwkwkwowk wtf baby factory? Can i have one from pinay? Im Indonesian
one child policy is the sollution
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=18m50s"">18:50</a><br>thank me later"
Better to have adopting agencies that would take care of unwanted teenage babies.<br>Most young teenage parents are not in school or member of any denominational Churches. So both government and Churches have work to do.
The world hates women all around the world in every way possible.<br>So sad
I call it plain stupid.....stupid having babies!  Having babies at 12 years of age is called child abuse!
"It&#39;s so disappointing that religious groups are being a**hole for preventing people from turning into contraceptives. Bad mouthing its use and scaring people about committing a sin or something. That&#39;s BS! Other countries are struggling with low birth rate but too much birth rate will really kill our economy. I just hope the church and the government will try to look into the practicality and positive effects of using contraceptives. &quot;Ihas ko&quot;, &quot;wala koy alamag ana&quot;, &quot;I was not properly educated&quot;. Until when are we going to hear this?"
"That governor still lived in stone age. Sir, 2019 na po kaya dumadaming naghirap eh"
Sad story üòëüòëüòëüòë
.... Yall are explotion these girls
"The documentary is sad but what about AIDs I dont think it was mentioned at all...their needs to be more education with all family members...its not alright ,these girls are babies themselves....it will always continue SO SAD!"
a hunger games or purge will help solve this problem
yes they must show all the difrent site of the phillipines not just the poor area and negative side
the Catholic church is the church of the devil
"I am so happy RH BILL was passed in senate. Situation like this, it should be well addressed with the current situation with our youth. Look at this teen mothers, this is what our government facing. The church didn&#39;t even realized this! Morals and teachings of the catholic church didn&#39;t really impleased on our real situation today!"
12 age of consent?  you filippinos are nuts...
The cycle of poverty never ceases.  Educate them to be independent and self-sufficient.
These are the people living in the cities and slums different from the rural areas.
God that woman&#39;s eyebrows are disturbing
This is the other side of the philippines everyone.
"I have to pause at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=7m19s"">7:19</a>, so when you report the guy who is left to take care of this young girl and their child  and his other children... wtf... but this is just all soo sadüò™. Way to go CHURCH"
This is what make Philippines and Thailand became famous. Stinksüò†üò†üò† shame

they need to pass out birth control in this country asap
üò•üò•üò•üò•üò• I do the same as them. When I was 16 I meet German guy and have baby girl. Then he leaves us just leave. But I take very responsible for myself and  baby.  Trying finish my highschool then go to Malaysia work as a caddy golf  for 10 years then go back to Indonesia and work cooking at BUMN.never married or  have any baby. I just want to make sure my üë∂ don&#39;t have the same life as I do. Thanks God now she finished her university and have a great job. Please girl who&#39;s raise baby don&#39;t make the same mistake to produce a nother baby and make them live in poverty. Sorry for my bad English
"&quot;Go forth and multiply&quot;,  sad"
Why are there so many skanks in the Philippines?
give them free condom and birth control phill
I have a couple friends in the Philippines and I wonder what their comments would be about this and what they have experienced.
ang gandang bata ni may2x hay sayang nkakaenis ung nanay nya

"This is heartbreaking I hope this serve as lesson or an eye opener to every parents, they should be the one who will give lecture how will their kids protect themselves for those people who will take advantage of their youth and givr guidance until they learn and be able to stand on their own."
So all the underage girls were raped basically
are condoms considered contraceptives? are they all against condoms? im confused
üòìüò¢
"first issue is white mans religions , second is white mans colonialism ,third white mans ways and interference"
You can all say what you want to Filipinos but the thing about us is that we will always be happy and smile at whatever shits happening to us.
You see.the thing about filipinos is that we are always happyüòÅ
"I feel like if they made it so that you could press charges without the consent of the child and parents, it would damage families"
The new reproductive health bill is being passed but guess who is blocking it.... the church!<br>It will diminish their ‚Äúflock‚Äùand interests. So the uneducated will remain uneducated. Hahaha
Well contraceptive isn&#39;t solution then I would like suggest homosexuality to cut down the overflowing pregnancy rate.
it&#39;s just sad...
"Wow! Ang ganda ng Manila! Lalong pinaganda ni Mayor Erap...lol! Mga basura, santambak, anong ginawa niya? Malapit na ang election sa Mayo, 2019....sana matuto na ang mga taga Manila kung sino ang iboboto nila."
Only in muslim communities allows minors to marry even with their own relatives.
Fake news. The legal age in Philippines is 18.
Being in that situation is a choice... Remember that you drive your own life. A lot of successful people is from poor family they just chose to search and work for their dreams beacause they see their life. These teenagers  are troublemakers.. They happen to be a &quot;sakit ng ulo&quot; both to their parents and barangays.. They chose that life to be a rebel to their parents..well that&#39;s the consequences.
"Seems like they don&#39;t have anything better to do..,Other than making babies."
"Di lang sa Pinas ganito mga Bulbol, walang perpektong bansa!"
Having children is a blessing..<br>Not only Catholic..Islam also teach Muslim to having children as many as possible. <br>Nothing wrong with that.
"I&#39;m stunned by the low age of consent and the acceptance of partners 5 to 10 years older than these little girls. Funny how the church voices outrage about contraception, but won&#39;t speak up about the predation."
I see they are good in bed while they are not prepare to become a mother
imagine being 11 and pregnant.........
Have mercy god
This is sad
"Age of consent for Sexual relations in the Philippines is 12<br><br>Age 18 is considered as the legal age<br><br>And if seeking marriage before the age of 22 (21 and below), parent&#39;s consent is needed here in the Philippines<br><br>WTF"
"This is ridiculous the Catholic Church has never approved of contraceptives , it‚Äôs not a sin not to have children or to use contraceptives . Of course is a man made law . Poor teenage girls"
"Well as a Filipino, Its really heart breaking to watch this üòû. 70% people of my country are suffering poverty. Teenagers are not educated enough to be aware of their actions, so that explain why there are moms at such young age and because of this, their children are forced to work early to keep them alive and abandoning their education in the process. Its like a cycle, repeating all over again."
I am Filipino and I am pretty sad that we are like this I thought we were better and every time I see someone holding a child(homeless btw) usually they have a lot of kids so now to know that they could be the parents and not siblings is terrible and kinda gross and it‚Äôs so annoying to think that they know their situation(having a hard life) yet they still have kids and when they have one they don‚Äôt learn they decide to get more it‚Äôs questionable honestly
"Even they are poor. Most have beautiful face, smile.."
When i was in 5 grade i saw classmates already has a boyfriend
I‚Äôm a filipino a know about this but I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs this worst
"This is not the face of the Philippines! This is the face of slums in the world. The article is so narrow and shallow. Its a     mediocre journalism. Not journalistic art work. This is not a cultural scenario in the Phils., it is a scenario in most slums. Well, its just a jeopardizing article."
This is sad and sick because these people that are supposedly pro life you&#39;re pro life thing at the expense of a twelve-year-old or younger you&#39;re making them be susceptible to pregnancy where they&#39;re already being abuse physically and mentally and raped made be parents so young so if being pro life means being pro abuse then they really really have their ship fuckup and all out of order the whole thing would pro life is that you save a life you help that life to have means to succeed how are you doing at by making a twelve-year-old a mom and a mom over and over in a place where they&#39;re struggling to eat each day can you say dumb as hypocrites a bit much
"Catholics are so perfect -  a disabled child fathered during rape by your own father  is a &quot;gift from god&quot;, but using a contraceptive is a &quot;sin&quot;.  That is probably why the catholic priests are so partial to buggering little boys - no need to &quot;sin&quot;"
We should separate the church and the government. Educate ourselves about contraceptives and family planning. Think the future of your child.
How stupid is the law. 12 is the age of consent but you are not allowed to but contraceptives till 18. Raise the consent 18.
Hmmmm...I‚Äôm still wondering if I should believe anything coming from a middle eastern news network???ü§îü§î so...what exactly is your agenda?
Because of Chinesse garterüòÇ
The advocate for birth control lost me when she brought up the UN...bunch of pedo scum bags
Respect my Post!
"I hate western media, they just show all the bad stuff from other countries. And then I hate those ignorant ppl who believes what the media shows them and not actually look deeper or see differently from what the media shows them. I def k people in the Philippines aren‚Äôt all like this, many of them are very well educated."
So they are scared of the side effects of contraceptives but not of the consequences and the suffering they have to go through of unplanned children
"I heard Javanese Gamelan traditional music from Indonesia at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=04m00s"">04:00</a>"
Ang lalandi!! Pwe!!!!
This is sad......I feel so sad for my fellow filipinos
Is it true that as soon as kids are born in Philippines they are encouraged to leave the country? I heard filipinos will do anything to leave the country and migrate to any country. I also heard that most filipino women only want to marry white men. They dont find their men attractive at all.
Seriously ... am from the Philippines but I don&#39;t even know this ....
Meanwhile in Japan....
I actually saw a Doc on PBS of the hospital where these ladies give birth. It was fascinating.....
What about the three kids he abandoned and now his old wife had to take care of the kids without the father in an impoverished situation already??? Those young girls and there parents sound like some of them are wanting their daughters to find a man so they can take one mouth to feed while the shady dude leaves all the kids he already hatched?!?!? Unbelievable.
"They should allow for adoption. I personally know many couples that would love to adopt a child and give him/her a wonderful life and home. It‚Äôs a touchy subject I know, because of the black market and shady people that shouldn‚Äôt be involved in the process. The money should go and only go for the mother to get a great education at a good college of her choice. Imagine how much that could potentially help the birth mother get out of poverty."
Meimei is so pretty it hurts
Raise the age of consent
"unfortunately, the Philippines is still under the control of the western and european governments.  Pilipinos think that we&#39;ve been freed... no we are not.  until now the owners of our Gold mines are americans and europeans.  most of our land that produces fruits, herbs, and vegetables are owned by other countries as well, and they harvest from our land and bring it to their countries to fatten their own people, while the Pilipinos starve and shoulder the very high price of our own local goods.  our government is still a &quot;puppet&quot; of these western and european countries, and to add to that - China, just recently.   at the moment, lots of Pilipinos are hired for a very low pay, while the capitalists and producers of goods sells us their products as well.  &quot;we work to death and we are also the consumers and buyers and we make them rich.&quot;   why lack of education? simple...   Pilipinos are kept illiterate for easy manipulation."
If i lived in that type of environment id never want to have children.
"&quot;I will not use contraceptives because it is against my religion, but I will fornicate and bang everyone in sight because it is not a sin.&quot;"
"it was one month before i turned 18 when i got pregnant, yes, i was very young, but i did make it sure that i will be a good mother to my baby. that i will sacrifice everything and do my best to give him all the best for him...i am not rich, i did not even finish my course, so i just had the minimum wage as a company employee...when i bring my baby out of this world, i took good care of him...gave the best i can, i never let him get dirty or smells bad...i keep him clean all the time because as for me i hate those kids who are dirty and smell bad(all the day) though the fact that they do have parents that can take care of them...<br><br>now my baby boy is turning 9 years old and i am 27,. i am here in KSA working for my kids, giving all the things that they need and they want...and being a young and single mother i can say that i am so proud of my baby because he grew up with a good heart... he is sweet and of course naughty, smart and he is one of the best students of their class(top 1 in his class) he even loves to join in contests such as poems and take note recently he was the champion, and now he is a member of drums and lyres of our place...<br><br>i say all this not to boast(but i am so proud)...that not all of the Filipino young woman who get pregnant early are irresponsible...it will always depends on the mother and on the love she have for her baby...<br><br>i am proud Filipino, single young mother...üáµüá≠üáµüá≠üáµüá≠"

This media aljazeera trying to pull down our country!  ! 80% of filipino&#39;s are living with wealth!  They just focus on poor people. .! !
legal age is 12!?!jeezus
So many friends in Philippine a single mother and deserved a better life. Very serious social and security issue.
Philippines for gods sake age of consent 12????Pedophilia legalised??? UN should enforce such countries to raise the age to 18 or 21.
Jesus. Give condoms to this women! <br>I hate see how this ‚Äúpro life‚Äù groups are ruining women‚Äôs rights around the world.
Education is what these young girls need.
She looks like katryn bernardo
This is sad

Sorry for being off topic but the NGO lady eyebrows are  throwing me off.
"just swallow a few litres of castor oil, there you go"
"put contraceptives in the water, stop this incessant breeding"
"Criminalizing these young men is not the answer. If you want to help then change the culture through education not going on people&#39;s country to prnalizev them.  Education empowers people  for change, break stigmas and ultimately change culture."
What?! Consent is 12?! That&#39;s not true at all!!!
"Mae/may may is so beautiful, I think she is really intelligent. This young kid should attend school to be educated but because of poverty she can&#39;t. How tragic, it breaks my heartüò¢"
Abstinence really you might as well tell the kids there is such thing as unicorns and fairies it‚Äôs all about education and contraceptives.
This is so sad. üò≠<br>The church &amp; govt are to be blamed.
Our country is made of thousands of Islands do you think we have all same situation? Have you been to other places? Because I never see this situation in our place. I live in Island of Bohol by the way. Your making a wrong impression by looking on  one side of the whole picture.
Sad what happens to these women
"Pregnancies: many women die, men risk nothing. So why are people still against abortion huh? These families and the country honestly can&#39;t sustain these infants, they are born to die or suffer. Stop forcing pregnancy, stop supporting ignorance. If you plan to have a kid, you must have the circumstances to benefit an *entire person*. If you don&#39;t have the circumstances to give them a prosperous life, do not have children! You cannot cross your fingers and hope for the best when talking about birth and sustainability."
"That guy with the blue shirt is wrong on so many levels. He thinks women shouldn&#39;t have rights in choosing to be pregnant. Wtf??? Forcing women to be pregnant is rape. And that is just so disgusting, unsustainable and RUINS the world for everybody."
it‚Äôs not their fault that they unfortunately do not have enough money to sustain their educational needs. it‚Äôs not their fault that they have their own beliefs.
In philipines a lot of young kids gets pregnant and they don‚Äôt know but then they notice and they say it was there self cause in philipines they play with kids in the streets I know most of this bc I‚Äôm Filipino
"They need to RIOT! Safety, education!"
God people need to get educated! And they need to give away birth control !
"Soo.. paedophile happy place, poor girl"
The number 1 cause of over population are the hypocrites catholic church who are docrinating the people not to use contraciptives .
"Yeah right, like other countries doesn&#39;t have like this issue! Philippines is no baby factory obviously Philippines is a big Country. We all know teen age is the most difficult stage in young people because of adolescence."
"maka ugly toh ng lugar, ganda ka teh? hindi diba? tsk napaka judgemental kala mo naman maganda"
I‚Äôm heart broken it girls living with their rapist that not boyfriends....
I&#39;m a product of abortion in the Philippines. I just lived because the &quot;matrona&quot; (abortionist) didn&#39;t do her job right and my biological mother couldn&#39;t bear to continue when she saw me come out.<br><br>Now I&#39;m happily adopted by a Canadian couple.
It&#39;s more fun in the Philippines yoooohooooo
"Not all of the filipinos are like this, some are well educated, some are respectful, some has good manners"
Maymay is such a beautiful girl....her story is just unfortunate and sad....she is trapped
But having children without marriage is against the Catholic Church
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have a boyfriend why don‚Äôt they cut these guys balls off
Why doesn‚Äôt this chick just not have kids huh?
üò¢üò¢üò¢
i cried within the first 3 mins. oh god.
"Im gratefull. Im half filipino, quarter scottish and quarter french (mother is Filipino, father is Scottish French) and I have a lot of friends and cousins even being pregnant or their girlfriend being pregnant.<br>Im just lucky I wasnt born in one of the poorer places... I was born in Makati City and moved to California at 2 years old. We do keep visiting Philippines though. And everytime we go there, I feel like there are too much people. There was someone who called us &quot;The richest in town&quot; since we donated 100,000 pesos to the poor but we didn&#39;t say anything because we were afraid to get robbed.<br>I feel really sorry for these people who suffer like this. They should live a happy normal life."
"i&#39;m a filipino and i did NOT know 12 is the age of consent.. this is just disgusting. filipinos shun those who reveal skin, get into silly relationships- yet blame the innocent girls for not taking care of themselves when something bad happens."
Im 34 and still happy to be single no responsibilities (haha)

"Musta naman mga Muslim, Seventh Day Adventist, INC etc???<br>Wala bang nagpapahalaga sa boses nila na puro na tayo Kristiyano Kristyano at Kristyano??"
Sooooo you&#39;re saying that they refuse to offer family planning and contraception but yet refuse to help these young mothers when these children are starving? Shocking.
Hay naku may nag sisinghot nanaman ng rugby!
This is horrible ! I lived in Philippines but haven&#39;t seen like this here. Only thing I knew here teenager gets pregnant in early age either before or after their studies. Hope this Stop happening.
Is this to push the use of contraceptives? It&#39;s funny using these stories to educate people in using contraceptives than educating people to learn discipline just as how it was. Contraceptives cannot cure crooked ideas and yielding mind. Personal &#39;discipline&#39; is needed. And real and well educated form of faith. Going to church is not a guarantee of instilling morality to people. Everything still goes back to discipline and getting proper education of their beliefs.
"The government should focus on education and job.This Government should have education program where those less fortunate children can go to school.This is not about educating them how to use contraceptive.Parents should  focus and encourage their children to be in school. The Government should give more effort how to help those area where those less fortunate live because those places where young teenage parent are more prevalent.Increase in population it also increase poverty, prostitution, and jobless .Robbery will also increase because no food to eat. Education, Job and good economy will help this people."
"My mom had her first child at 20 before she moved to America, her being raised in the same city she was taught this was normal but when she began her life in America and had me she taught me to try hard and never depend on a man to make your earnings, even how hard it is, she&#39;s very strict with me because she does not want me to end up in a situation she had to grow up seeing, seeing this makes my stomach turn. I&#39;m truly grateful for my mom and what her teachings had brought me. This is a very dark side of the Philippines"
"Dear foreign people watching this who doesn&#39;t know anything about the Philippines...<br><br><br><br>What you see in the this video (poverty, teenage moms, the environment) it doesn&#39;t symbolize the Philippines, I&#39;ve been to the Philippines and expecting this kind  of environment but much to my surprise only a small portion of the Philippines is like this and the majority are not so poor communities, so dont get the wrong idea that Philippines is a small and poor country."
"Lies all lies, poor kid"
"They need to raise the age of consent or better yet make it illegal to have children before marriage (people will complain but that&#39;s so much safer). Then raise the allowed age of marriage. That will seriously help.<br><br>But knowing this Government, that isn&#39;t going to happen...."
<b>USE. CONDOMS</b>
"I&#39;m Filipino. Born and raised and I could say this video is a bit exaggerated. Teenage pregnancy is a problem here, yes, but its not as bad as this video made it out to be. They went to a place where it is rampant. Of course everyone there would be teenage moms. And Fabella hospital? That thing&#39;s a baby factory, I have worked there as a nurse and while many that give birth are teenagers, not everyone are. Even people in normal circumstances give birth there because it&#39;s cheap. The people featured here are obviously poverty striken and had very little education because they too are most likely raised that way. The catholocism in the Philippines is also a contributing factor but not because it discourages contraception but because it intervenes with the Government too much. And to people who do not believe abstinence is impossible. IT IS. Its a matter of self control and self value. If they were taught that inside their home that things would have turned out differently. And wtf about giving consent at 12, that&#39;s BS. I was 28 when I got married and had to provide consent."
But the babies are so cuteüò≠
and she basically has to have that bf bc otherwise it&#39;s harder to live being so poor on your own
Don‚Äôt nobody have a pull out game out thereü§î
kasi tayong mga pilipino malalambot ang puso pag nabuntis mga anak anak di matiis ng magulang tatanggapin nlang ssabhin anjan na yan blah blah kaya wlang takot na ang mga anak kse alam nila matatanggap den e sa ibang bansa kase ikinahihiya pag maaga nabuntis anak halos palayasen itakwil mas lamang yung pride nila kaya yung mga kabataan takot gumawa ng kahihiyan.
As a filipino i finally have a courage to watch this video lol
Catholic is a big trash
Stupid government
You gotta realize this is a place with high activity of pedophiles. Baby factory for a reason in my opinion. Consent at 12? I was raped at 12 this is nuts
It was awkward to give her advice about contraceptives at 14 because she was too young üòëüòí foolishness
They on their 20s be looking like 40s and 50s.....so sad
"Just to clear up stuff for all the foreigners, not all of us Filipinos get pregnant at a young age and live below the poverty line, please keep all your rude thoughts to yourselves , thank you"
I hate how she said theses people are living in a slum
"Politicians in the Philippines don&#39;t care, they are just into self-preservation. They don&#39;t really care about what happens to the citizens of the country."
very sad that so many girls in my country believe that this is all a woman is born for.

They are just kids... they are being abused and forced to do stuff like this.. thats horrible
Wait a min  11 year old with a 22 year old is rape and that is disgusting and she was pregnant.
Its hard to beleive that people really dont know sex=baby. STDs can be confusing and tricky...but come on now. sex=baby. especially if youve already had one.
Third world countries will continue to be in peril until they stop with the religious bullshit and closed minded nonsense. This is an easily reducible issue.

"There are antivaxxer right? Did these babies got vaccinated or not? If they didn&#39;t because poverty and irresponsible uneducated lazy parents, and the babies survived. Maybe we really should re evaluate our choice ..<br>My point is, nothing. I didn&#39;t even know what Im talking about .."
The government here is putting the responsibility of preventing rape and teen pregnancy on the victims. I was briefly a fan of the new pope but this honestly is too horrific to forgive.

"And the worst thing is, almost all these girls are living in bad conditions. In other words they are living in poverty and can barely support themselves."
YES an happy ending for these women!! still scared for the 13 y/o tho i hope she finds a solution üò¢üò¢
Keeping contraceptives from people does not lead to abstinence. It leads to women and children in poverty. The church may be right to  encourage abstinence but to prevent proper sexual protection is sinful. God gives us choice; the church is not responsible to prevent choice. This is a typical choice to focus on one aspect of the problem without considering the consequences.
Im german and i have a lot of phillipine friends here and in the phillipines too they are kind and friendly i love them all üòò AND  its not only the phillipines where young girls get pregnant it is everywhere in the world !!!
"Wow, this is an eye opener. Yet, all the babies are adorable ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
These countries have their laws and allow this to happen but it has been going on for decades. . It is  good to be aware but every country has its issues. This country needs to learn how to solve it&#39;s own issues. . It&#39;s their laws  and that&#39;s where it issues  start. But it&#39;s also a cash cow ..keep feeding the  cow money and the devil wins ..Catholic Church.  Just terrible.

This happens mostly in luzon area.. maybe there is also in visayas and mindanao but luzon is manier.. i have met young mothers in visayas aged 17+<br>And mindanao mostly are 17+ also<br>Most of their reasons of getting pregnant in very young age is because of family problem<br>Some of them they are working in their early age and met a man

who puts these laws that allows the age of consent to be as low as 12? only pedophiles in power do that.
"So abortion is illegal? ??wow ,just wow.What country is this???no disrespect but really."
"Welp, I&#39;m depressed now."
I love the gov&#39;t official who thinks he can tell kids not to screw.....reminds me of my friends who think their teens are virgins when they&#39;re certainly weren&#39;t virgins at their age.....

Wag na iboto tong si Dennis Socrates ang bobo eh.
just another example of how church and state don&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t mix. You can believe whatever you want Barbra but human rights and equality should always come first for the betterment of society. Bible toting lunatics.
Just a Reminder For Y&#39;all  Kids/Teenagers giving birth is not only whats happening in the Philippines why look in the dark side when there is a Bright Side.....i know someone will say &quot;wE ShOuLD FoCUs oN tHEsE&quot; but its also hurtful that people are saying that &quot;Philippines cant handle there own country&quot; or &quot;Americans shouldn&#39;t have let them go&quot; Just Saying: We didn&#39;t ask for your comments/opinions
"I agree with the presented pint of view, but this was so biased it&#39;s disgusting. A disgrace to journalism and the reason why I don&#39;t watch mainstream media."
Wow! Did this people think protections and birth controls are legal?!! This makes me upset big time! Read a bible you people! If you think you&#39;re doing is a good thing Think again!<br>Edit: Instead of teaching them you really choose giving them birth controls should I clap backwards? or clap in filipino way?
"&quot;Refrain from defending yourselves or the image of our country  from ill judgments people make towards us and stop comparing our nation with the other nations&quot; - this is my plea to my fellow Filipinos. <br><br>Being the second in nine children and the oldest daughter, I have not only witnessed but above all, experienced the extreme effect of poverty as a result of the immaturity of my uneducated mother and irresponsible father. At a very young age, sometimes, I would act as a mother to my siblings when my parents would go on a whole day of work in the farm. But as I grew up, the  more that I worked with my older brothers in the farm and make a living. But I always had a big dream and I was always had a hope that one day, I will be able to bring my family out of poverty. From our house to our school, it was 6 km on foot. We never cared about the distance as long as we could go to school. Me  and my siblings relied  on scholarships and being working students to support our studies. Now, life has become a lot better. <br><br>I truly believe that everything and everyone, whether big or small, has a contribution in all these social problems our country is facing now. But what is the use of pointing fingers and blaming each other? What help can it do? NONE. <br><br>Discrimination and negative things other country people say about Filipinos and the Philippines also crush my heart into pieces. But I want to encourage everyone to consider these things as constructive feedback. A challenge for us to take; to start working hand in hand to reconstruct our nation into a better one. <br><br>We can start by recognizing our flaws and accepting our faults. Then we educate ourselves as much as we can so we can also help other people get educated, instead of discriminating them.  <br><br>There are different medium we can use - social media as one - to spread good  information and help the youth become aware of a lot of helpful things to build their characters and become more responsible citizens. <br><br>It might be a long way to go but I can only imagine what UNITY and selfless LOVE can do."

"What&#39;s ironic about these documentaries made by foreign media is that they portray the reality of what&#39;s really going on in this country compared to their local counterparts.

"Catholic Church is some kind of business..

What do they think is going to happen?  It&#39;s the same in this country.  Children in poverty and babies raising babies is not a serious health issue but abortion is.  Education is definitely key to solving the problem.  In addition women need to stick together world wide to elevate each other regardless of country or culture.  Men stick together but women do not.  That is why we as a gender continue to suffer.  Feminists around the world need to put pressure on their government to deal harshly with these misogynist governments and religious nuts.  Abstinence is just not going to happen, unfortunately, so it&#39;s time for real working solutions."

Under 18 os child abuse in phil its the first time i learned that the age of consent is 12. Why in the world if you are under 18 you are not allowed to marry?
It‚Äôs happened because of eourpe tourists mans
So sad that in my country the rate of being uneducated is so high.<br>Thats why the rate of teenage pregnancy is so high :(
wtf no the legal consent in philippines is 18
Change the age but it wont do any good
The interviewer/s basically insert themselves in the lives of consenting adults with consenting young adults at liberty of law and conscience to do what they want and do do. I feel so bad for those disapproving of baby making. There are worse things than babymaking; it&#39;s so sad that you don&#39;t understand how precious and rare the gift of life is.
Why does the Filipino government condone pedophilia? Shouldn‚Äôt the civilized world take action at some point to stop this?
I&#39;m a Filipino and Catholic but I remember leaving the church in the middle of homily when the priest was campaigning against the Reproductive Health Bill. I think we can practice our faith and still be pragmatic. To not be blind to the reality. It&#39;s also a sin to bring to the world kids that you know won&#39;t be given the life that they deserve. Our laws are also obviously outdated. How can you have an age of consent of 12 yrs and yet require parents&#39; consent for an HIV test unless you&#39;re above 18 yrs?
And people in the US think they should lower the age of consent . Like no 18 is fine cuz at least then you know a little better and can get  medical help such as birth control or an abortion
Age of consent is 12?! This is why so many sick minded men go here to visit. Bet.
Omg I&#39;m filipina I&#39;m already 27 years old but I don&#39;t have boyfriend hahahaha.
bring back matriachy for the poverty.... that might help.
"contraception doesn&#39;t have side effect, not as bad as having 1000000 babies"
"I&#39;m also from Philippines and this is one of the biggest problem here in the Philiippines. The early pregnancy of teenagers, even not teenagers, even kids around 9 and up. I hope that in the coming months, years from now, more opportunities and work will open, not only for educated people but also for uneducated people. I believe that, everyone should have a work. Everyone needs to be busy working so they don&#39;t think of making more babies. Specially, when they can&#39;t raise them well."
"Legal age of consent for marriage is not 12, that&#39;s untrue."
Offer these women the chance to be sterilized!!!! Many will take it .
its fate..
Lmao my mama better be thankful I‚Äôm 20 and never once did I become pregnant
i dont see jailing the father as a good solution. They are now a family. Too late for that. Whats the obsession with Westerners and their desire to tear families apart?
Outrageous     These people have no pride and
"The Philippines&#39; Baby Factory | 101 East | Ang Pabrika ng Sanggol ng Pilipinas It says.:&quot;The Fabric of the Branching Fruits of the Philippines&quot; It is not a problem to the Philippine Government. Predominantly Catholic, the government does not believe in abortion, but the joy of babies. A high rate of teenage pregnancy is not &quot;an ugly reality&quot;; infant mortality as well as the mother&#39;s are more pressing concerns. This British filmmaker implies the scandal of the age of consent being 12 in the Philippines; Britain had that law, and still does. The Philippine Government also does not, officially, believe in funding contraception."
"BS, the mother didn&#39;t want better for her daughter so she kept her mouth shut. This is the ugly head of jealousy."
The Philippines is so backwards. So many social problems. The politicians just talk but offer no solutions.
PEDOPHILES!!!!!
A morally depraved culture. These creatures don&#39;t even behave like human beings knowing right from wrong. They have much to fear from Christ.
"That kind of reality that Philippine Government doesn&#39;t care at all despite of all  legal Laws ,because 75percent of politicians in the Philippines are Corrupt and stupid"
just pull out yo
THEY ARE BALANCING LIKE BANGLADESH
WHY ALWAYS COSMIC TALK TO CONTROL OTHERS<br>TYRANTS ARE PREACHING HOW TO TAKE CONTROL OF HALF OF THE POPULATION <br>THAT IS WOMEN
"I honestly don&#39;t feel bad for these people. My family worked there when I was a child. No matter how much education you give them, the majority are stuck in very old beliefs and still go on doing what they want. Meanwhile children are being born in the same vicious cycle. Hospital workers will suggest family planning and most would turn it down. They rather believe old wives tales than listen to a professional."
"Reality  90  percent  parents  are not talking  about  contraceptives...lack  of orientation... sino  ba Yang Governor  na yan  tulog sa servisyo..<br>,"
"When ur educated, then it is less likely to experience these problems of early pregnancy.. The catholic teaching is not heard tru communities where couples live.. From foreign perspective,  i think,  they think us to be weird in a sense that we dont practice for what we think is right.. We ranked 12th in the list of the most populous countries, whereas we ranked 73 in terms of list of countries per land area.. So meaning were booming so fast in terms of baby making.."
These poor pinoys be getting laid alot while we average Filipinos still complain about being a virgin.
Im a filipino judging by my name these people are squatters(outcast) they dont have a real home Theyre dumb because they keep doing drugs. That the rich upper class distributes
ALL THE POOR COUNTRY HAVING ONLY ONE JOB TO INCREASE POPULATION
Proud to be Fili.... NVM
I am filipino this is true yet slowly changing i see it with my contemporaries they choose to have fewer children because it is wiser and more manageable
I feel that I‚Äôm not proud of this country anymore after watching.I wanna leave soon.
They need to raise the age of consent to save these kids from having children so young... might not completely stop it but sure would help.
I want the puppy in the back round!
The Philippines is a dump and always will be
Wake up to your selves the Catholic Church is the religious financial institution that forbids bith control.They are just a money making enterprise that hides behind there doctrine.Large asian countries like the Philippines need birth control<br> Make female contraception legal and the over population will be cured witin 1 generstion ie25 yesrs.Why increase a countries population if the host country cannot support the infrastructure to keep there citizens health and well being the utmost priority üòÇ
Religion has screwed us all up. Just horrible. &quot;I&#39;m a Catholic so I can&#39;t use contraceptives&quot; -  smh
I don&#39;t want to see white people talking about this issue....
enlightening
"I don&#39;t know. I am a Filipino, 25, and still believes that I am too young to have a baby. Same goes to my friends too. They say your environment shapes your life. If a teenager&#39;s environment is filled with teenage pregnancy, it is likely that it will be like her too. But if a teenager grew up to environment where the people prioritizes success then it is likely he will too. It is a matter of changing the environment, not the circumstance. Truly, I&#39;ve been surrounded with teenage pregnancy in my teenage years, my mom got pregnant with my Ate at 18, my cousins got pregnant at 15. But I am too lucky that I have to leave that environment to pursue studying to a more decent place. If I continue living in that same environment, I might have had my 4th child now. Now, 25, engaged. My fiance and I plans to have a child after 3 years of marriage."
The catholic religion is the biggest curse for the Philippines and Filipinos.
Sex Education is REALLY MUST.
Economic and health disparities between the underserved and unprivileged poor and powerful and influential rich widens even more because the rich have access to healthcare and excellent education. Why do you think the rich in the Philippines have fewer children than the poor?  It is because they have access to birth control.
If the Catholic Church is advocating childhood pregnancy without supporting birth control or any other options then the Church should pick up the tab for all those Babies and Baby moms.
What is that wrapped around their stomach at the hospital
"So sad, it is obvious Maymay at the tender age of 12  is still very much a child, she should be playing with dolls not men, going to school and living a child&#39;s life.  Some man comes along whispering sweet nothings in her ear and within no time a Child is having a Child. At age 12 a young girl is thinking a girls thoughts she has years of growing up to do. Birth control should be free and    easily obtainable at any age.  Children having children is not the answer, education is the answer.  Poor girl a mom at 12.  Why?"
I think the main problem is the law. They should raise the age of consent from 12 to 18 or older. Young pregnancy creates poverty and steals childhood from people especially women.
And there are  als some country  10 years old are ready to marry  watch  all over the  world
Wow look whose talking  about philippines  12 or 13 years old pregnant  what about in the usa is there not the samethings  lol watch  all over the world  not Just in the philippines peace
At least he cared!! More than one can say for this culture ( North American)!
"Hindi na life ito suffering forever, no education,not enough food, no formal shelter,"
Our country must allow abortion
It&#39;s so sad how uneducated these people are...
"You can also blame the media for this.... Especially those videos that keeps making love stories, songs, pickup lines, etc."
Catholic church in philippines was un useful they are greedy and corrupt!..only knows how to against the recent government instead of helping bcoz they most bad people and doing many bad things..!.
Isn&#39;t aborting a fetus at 5 months worse than preventing pregnancy by using contraceptives?
"I been here for 30 year&#39;s, I am a baptized catholic christian( from Muslim), I can not believe much low mortality in this christian country. Lie by government in big problem in this beautiful country and people of it."
Wtf.. whole planet going dwnüëÄ
I feel too aaawkward to teach my children about life.<br><br>Said the responsible adult.<br>.
We are too stupid to understand the intricacies attached with this subject of early teenage pregnancy.State Government gets huge loans not only from the church but from the church AFFILIATED institutions.They are the foot soldiers for the western ageing population
The Catholic Church has doomed the beautiful country with it&#39;s wonderful peoples.  Age of consent is 12? Must change this also.  Cutekinoko is right on!
...There are some loopholes with this documentary and I find it offensive.
No wonder there are many Filipino parents (katulad ng sakin) who always say &quot;Wag ka muna mag asawa&quot; (Don&#39;t get married yet) or &quot;Wag ka muna mag-anak&quot; (Don&#39;t have a baby yet) to their kids even if they&#39;re in college already
Those filipino  should know that before having a baby or family atleast they could support themselves . They&#39;re poor nd they dont even know how hard if they produce more? . God im filipino im sad to know about these issues . Sila ung tao n ngpapahirap p lalo s bansa tbh sorry for the word but yeahüòë
"Unmarried pregnancy??<br>Really sick,,,,"
"Here&#39;s a fact. Poor Filipinos are the ones that irresponsible in this kind of things. Sad fact. They should have thought about the consequences of teenage pregnancy. If you&#39;re rich that&#39;s ok, if not then forget about having a child."
Philippines one of the biggest problem is Religion itself. They ask for separation of church and state when the government interferes with their wrong doing. But they are interfering with the government. They even demand for laws that relates to the bible. Like WTF is that?
Every government sucks.
Men in the Philippines are like hamster cant have a self control. Thats why prostitute are arising in the Philippines.
Age of consent is 18 not 12 !! This doc&#39;s are all lies ..it makes to degrade the filipino people !
How the F is the Philippine government gonna explain to the rest of the world that the age of consent under Philippine law is 12 years old???
Tell me are there any laws for a father that abandon his 3 kids an leave them in poverty
"Teenagers are so hard headed. They only think about boyfriend girlfriend, love... Filipinos teenagers, wake up! Help your parents, study first, having job then marry. Hope this video is a lesson for you all!"
He must screw young girls that&#39;s why he&#39;s ok with it. Then he said women shouldn&#39;t be allowed to abort but the men leave them who tell the women not to abort. Messed up
"Education is the key, education is the weapon... Everyone deserves well educated. I&#39;m sorry for those girls"
This is so primitive it&#39;s 2018 already.
YASSSS!! THAT BOY WHO AGREE ON NOT EVERYONE CAN CONTROL THEMSELVES!! BLESS YOU!!! I was jst thinking it before he said it üòÇüòÇüòÇ

"hoy ako ay 10 taong palang, wag nyo pong sabihin na lahat ng pilipino ay mahihirap, merong mga tao na pure filipino na as ing sobraaaaaang mayaman, hindi ko sinasabing mayaman din ako, Normal lang ang buhay ko, ang sinasabi ko lang na hindi lahat ng pilipino ay mahihirap o may mahihirap na trabaho gaya ng trash collector o domestic helper, sinasabi ko lang :)"
What wow at 11 i was at the skate park with my mates enjoying being a kid this is sad to see this kids getting knocked up there not even fully grown yetüò¢
As a catholic my self I am 100% against the ideal they are implementing!! like stop them from getting pregnant because abortion is a bigger sin!! wth is going on
&quot;abstinence till married&quot; ...no....educate women and girls about birth control. abstinence is not realistic. This is why i&#39;m bothered by how strong the Catholic Religion is intertwined with government.
Sad sad üò¢
Its disgusting how women live in other countries disgusting
"He&#39;s right...abstinence is the key..but in the event that the men need to be sterilized and possibly paid to do so..since it seems they&#39;re the issue, raping young girls."
Pabrik aka Pabrika. Bayi aka Sanggol
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=5m28s"">5:28</a> a proud lolicon"
I would love to adopt a baby ....I don&#39;t know how to start.....I&#39;m not rich but I can take care and raise a child in the USA...I don&#39;t understand why it is a hard issue for people that want to raise a child...and in a happy home
"Liar! You liked it, you knew it will happen and still chose to do it! The problem is, your parents are trying hard to enroll you to a school, and you guys don&#39;t want to learn! Then you blame it either to the government or the system."
"What happened to this country ? back in the 50&#39;s,60&#39;s and 70&#39;s a girl cannot even  attend a ball,unless a high school dance like Junior Prom or Senior prom.12 years olds would still be playing skipping rope,running race and all sort of child play."
So for God? We send out stupid messages to young people? What in all that is good? Is it doing to help? Absolutely NOTHING. Shame on any Christian who would support this.
Most men in this video are useless and paedophile üòë
Ang ganda ng bata. Sayang naman ang buhay ang aga nag-asawa. :(
First step should be to rise the age of concent from 12 to 18
THIS IS SOME BS OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE
Seven months pregnant and she&#39;s not aware?? Is she ultra dumb or what?
"I&#39;m 21 and I&#39;m single and virgin. Oh, well."
Yuck
"Omg,like is that real?like is Philippine that poor??üò¢wee!!i am sad for these folks."
"I, for one, am angry and disgusted more than sad...my own people, what are you doing? Age of consent is 12 years of age?! Abstinence is the only form of ‚Äúcontraception‚Äù?! 22 year old with a 13 year old...umm....pedophilia????!! The laws in the Philippines need to be more stricter. Public and private education need to be reformed; instead just preaching abstinence be realistic and educate them about contraceptions. It‚Äôs easier said than done but still‚Äîa tween (11 year old) got pregnant and was basically forced to do it. WTF?!!!"
i feel they living like dogs
"I gave money for the women on Apo Island  so they all could get a injection for a half year of protection. They were sick of having babies all the time.  (a friend lived there for 6 years, so she bought all the stuff and more for this) I&#39;m proud to those women who took things in their own hands. It is also their body, their live."
Thank you mom and dad....

"Wow looking back, I&#39;m kinda glad I left the Philippines even tho I love my country so much it&#39;s just a mess smh"
ini dia negara yg tiada pegangan hidup dan moral.negara pengamal seks bebas

Did anyone else want to grab that puppy and take it home. :(
"I&#39;m a filipino and our country began to be extremely poor when the time of the AQUINO FAMILY, during the time of our late President Ferdinand Marcos our country is very progressive ,discipline, and organize, during Ferdinand Marcos time there is no even poverty, our country is very rich. I&#39;m just sad that those AQUINO family, try to remove our president Ferdinand Marcos just for their own interest for themselves and really not for our country, they even brainwashed us filipinos, saying that during Ferdinand Marcos time there is a huge killings, so during AQUINO ADMINISTRATION  time our country began to fall, because of the increasing poverty and also  people became so violent and not discipline, the number of drugs and criminals increases, and there is a huge CORRUPTION, specially the Leaders. It&#39;s sad but it is the reality, that&#39;s why our country PHILIPPINES didn&#39;t really progress. I hope that time will repeat itself during our  President Ferdinand Marcos, he is really a true filipino with a heart for his own country.(sorry for my english)"
"wait, I don&#39;t understand. To protect yourself by using contraceptives you need parents permission, but to be raped is not!!!!! WTF"
All I know is that those are some of the most beautiful children in the world.
The caption is so misleading üòÇüòÇ i am a Filipina and i was like what? üò±üò±üò±üò±üò± Baby Factory ? The Philippines ? üò±üòÇüòÇüòÇ like really üòÇ üòèüòèüòè i never knew my Country recognize as a Baby Factory üòäüòÇ
People in power that think like Yosef MacGruber are one of the many reasons the Philippines can never get a grip when it comes to their uncontrollable population.
Abortion is illegal but they have a whole hospital ward dedicated to the after math of them doing it illegally...this is sad. Their bodies are not ready...these poor babies of babies
These girls are being RAPED RAPED RAPED and under ‚Äúreligion‚Äù and ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù these LITTLE GIRLS are pushed off and left behind SMH SMH SMH
The bad thing on the Philippines is that they believed on god so much like 99% of filipinos are religious they always relies on their gods.. I wanted to go to shool thats non religion.. now i am forced to study christian living.. i feel like people who believes in god r extremly delusional. I just feel sad when theres someone crying on the church and wishing for their happiness.. its just hard.. &quot;gods&quot; r supposed to motivate u when you have something to wish like ur the one who is motivating and feel better after u wish it to god.. its just you. Who made it and some people who relies on gods too much r the people who has a poor life..<br> i have this mass card thing where i had to go to church and we need to sign it from the priest when the mass is done. :/
&quot;I&#39;m happy I have a beautiful wife&quot;<br>Wtf. How is that beautiful lol
So much love yet so much hardship. Such a shame. üòø
"Corrupted church, corrupted government, foolish girls and stupid boys"
In such growing population and if Goverment does nothing to overcome it will be at losing ground!
I didn&#39;t know our country has been dubbed as the &quot;baby factory&quot; .
Lol I live in the Philippines but never knew the age of consent was <b>12</b>
"maybe the strategy of this nation is to have the manpower in next 20 years to become more powerful than other populated countries and have a stronger army than now. Also, taking help of religion to make public into believing something which is not true (eg. contraception). the public doesn&#39;t understand because they are scared to disobey religion. <br>Another thing, why NGOs are providing contracption?<br>because they care about people but government cares about power. even NGOs will be struggling to get contraception if the government decides to strengthen their will towards the goal.  <br>Government here is going wrong because destroying young generation will destroy future. <br>maybe I am looking into this in a whole different way which may be wrong. just a guess."
That poor puppy
Abstinence ! That way you can still be true to your religion and also have common sense and not reproduce if you aren‚Äôt financially ready. As I was typing the religion coach said abstinence as wellüòå
thirsty
"I thought the legal age was 14, WTF, now 12, that&#39;s insane."
Why there government aloud this to happen why there are just little girls shame on the government Phillips the social security office don&#39;t care
"<b>Mandatory vasectomies for the men, until they are OF AGE and WITH a good paying JOB!   PERIOD!</b>"

Oh no lord help
"After so many children, I think damaging the uterus is the least of their problem"
My cousin just gave  birth to her first this year and shes about to turn 19 i think but her boyfriend is sweet and he took care of her and their baby
The poor animals and babies living in those awful conditions and being treated that way just horrific
of course the catholics are behind this....
raise the age of consent. PLEASE
"So, even though it is disgusting that these much older men are having children with teenage girls. And even though it is morally wrong. And even though you could press charges even without the girl‚Äôs consent... You really probably shouldn‚Äôt. If nobody wants to press charges, it probably has a reason. The reason most likely is survival. If the parents are happy they have one less mouth to feed, that says something about their financial situation. What would happen to the girl and her child when the man is locked up? <br><br>You can‚Äôt just come to the Philippines with an American view on life and then expect that everything will work out the same. There is no welfare state in the Philippines. Actions can have much graver consequences over there than in America."
"Anywhere you find the Catholic Church, you find pain, suffering, and poverty."
"The age of consent should be raised to 16, these men are paedophiles and creeps."
This is not about religion it‚Äôs about these girls listening to their partners who are pedophiles!
abortionist...rubbish!
OMG! Can&#39;t believe this after watching on utube. Fault of parents.
‚ÄúCapability to control ourselves‚Äù.....
üòû
"Is obvious that asking kids to practice abstinence until marriage has not work at all so why not just give them contraceptives and sexual educaci√≥n because once they get in heat nothing is going to stop them, if you think otherwise you just part of the problem...are you listening parents."
This is why the philippines will always b poor. No family planning &amp; education &amp; no money. Why doesn‚Äôt the Catholic Church do anything about it?
"You can thank the corrupt Roman Catholic Church for Philippines population problem.  The church would rather have poor, uneducated masses filling their donation baskets than actually solving the country&#39;s problems. Thank you Pope Francis!!"
"I love the fact that people are clean and hygienic no matter where they lived, the slums or other places. Good for them."

"In the town I left there is catholic college, where the abortion rate is very high amongst students.  I live in Australia."
This is probably the saddest thing I&#39;ve watched. I have no words.
Filipinas! Your machismo culture is debilitating and disgusting.
Its not the poverty. not the government. but the over population itself. catholic church is the reason why contraceptives are not allowed. im a catholic yet i disagree with that. really.
why girls in the Philippines are taught like this? <br>-That if you lose your virginity to that guy he must be the one. <br>-If someone raped you and got you pregnant it will be ok if you live with your attacker.<br> - and girls who aren&#39;t virgin anymore owes the guy so much if he accepted the girl despite not being virgin anymore.<br>It&#39;s so stupid.
Nakakaawa naman ito.<br>Ngayon ko lang nalaman ang tungkol sa age of consent ngunit naunawaan ko na ito kaagad. Yung babae halos kasing edad ko lang pero may bf na at nabuntis na. Nakakalungkotüò¢üò¢üò¢. Dahil tyak ito sa poverty

"as a filipino myself, i never knew the age of consent is 12 at all."
Is it a taboo to get a conceptrive in philipines? It seems the church really does not want the girls to wear those. I am muslim from malaysia where family planning is allowed.
I&#39;m 152 years old and proud of being single..‚úå And glad that I wasn&#39;t born in the Philippines.
Wow I never know this is going on in Manila.ok don&#39;t know she was pregnant? Very sad.
"This documentary struck me for i am a single mother at age 23, now im 26 and my daughter is 3. The guy was 43 and offered me anti biotics for abortion but abandoned me after i choose life. I know One day he gets KARMA"

takot mag birth control pero di takot manganak  :) epik
"legal age of consent is 12 ???? ...not true.... reason why there are a lot of teenage  pregnancy is lack of education, poverty  etc,,, Unlike western countries, the Phils. is highly religious to know more about family planning and contraception... We have too much positive outlook no matter how idiotic it may seem...."
This is so sad knowing that there are so many problems here in the PH.  These kids are only victims of povertyüò¢ this is so heart breaking üíî
You see what good are these skanks getting pregnant for society this is disgusting culture pathetic government officials should be ashamed of themselves üò§
Snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is THE poor in philippines  i havet alredy see this in realy .
It&#39;s the boys/men that are essentially raping the girls/women and they talk about abstinence and blame the girls for not upholding their &quot;purity&quot;? such hypocrisy just adds to the level of disturbingness of the whole situation
In fairness she looks pretty:-)
I am so disgusted by this! Age of consent is  12!!
"I‚Äôm over here 25 and never had a boyfriend, and I don‚Äôt think I will ever have one at this rate."
"Ofc the age of consent is 12 year in a catholic run country. &quot;Save yourself til&#39; you&#39;re married, unless you&#39;re an altar boy&quot;"
The one girl had 2 kids while underage then the dad left her for someone else and took their kids. He should be arrested for kidnapping!
This is not the majority of Philippines right? This must happen in rural areas or something. I refuse to believe the whole country is like that
that game is called Missippi
Being governed by Japan might not have been such a bad idea after all...
Abstinence Only.  When grown men are going around raping and impregnating children. Okay then.
"I once live in manila and I live in squatter area. It was very hard for me to live there for 1 month. I just stayed there beause of my uncle living there and I don&#39;t have anyone in manila except him. <br><br>I live in Province of Iloilo.<br>Its very far different the way of living there. <br><br>I encountered young people with children, people using drugs, beggars and a very narrow and smelly place. I just stayed inside the house. I&#39;m afraid going outside because of the dangerous scenario outside of the squatter. It so sad and scary seeing them living like that. and I think my room in province is bigger than their houses."
I can&#39;t believe like this situation still exists at Philippine. Because they are one of the biggest communities. According of their life style in UAE. But I was wondering about their population..... not anymore.
Me 49 have job but still single
More of politicians afraid of losing the catholic vote.
"Kahirapan kasi, wala nang nasa isip kundi kantutan, maski mga DH sa abroad kantutan din nasa isip... tradisyon na minana sa ninuno di bale na raw mahirap, basta mayaman sa anak....."
This is so sad. I just‚Ä¶ I have no words.
Very sad
"That&#39;s the reality of life in the Philippines.  The reason why poor becomes poorer.  Ignorance and lack of education are the big factor.  So pitiful coz the poor think how to survive thru the love of the same person, poor just like them."
"Yes, this is unfortunately and common in Philippines. They don&#39;t even their finish education, then they get a boyfriend and get pregnant. I hope this won&#39;t be common anymore in Philippines (actually I hope that this won&#39;t happen in other countries)."
"Some young couple,, have no stable job but still like to produce plenty children,, WheW! They don&#39;t think the future of their children,, they are happy every night a couples of an hour, thats what they like it!"
god will &quot;save&quot; them
"Ah Philippines, where religion comes first rather than future."
12 ?!?!? What the actual fu!!!!!
This is the cause of irresponsible parenthood.Why bear many children if you can&#39;t able to feed them.Then you will blame the government.The Catholic church opposed contraceptive but didn&#39;t help the government in overcoming poverty.They are busy in fighting against government in their sermons and rallying.
Mga potanginang bobo
Masogenistic ALL THE WAY. Sickening.
"Even away from poverty, say middle class... young women getting pregnant or marrying early is still pretty common. It‚Äôs because education and work opportunities are low but romanticism is rampant."
I think Philipino government should bombard this place with condoms and birth control pills
Every life is good even if born in a poor family....Ok. Even if the child starves to death because mom is 14 and boyfriend leaves her destitute....SICK!!

"If i ever get rich, god!! i promise i will go to these countries and make a huge program for young boys and girls, special girls, to teach them and educate them, so they can grow and get out of that endless circle of poverty. I will love to make many schools not only to teach them but also to prepare them, so they can apply to universities and then apply for future jobs."
This is rape
The lawmakers must be a bunch of pedophiles.
you know what we do to male animals who cant control their sexual urges?
Stupid people.

Can&#39;t abort a foetus even if the mother may be in danger is a pretty sure sign that religion/group/party is wrong...

That jumping game... we have that in Kenya too... not sure we have a name for it though
just stop having babies u sick people
"It&#39;s all well and good for these &#39;religious&#39; groups to harp on about &#39;abstinence&#39; and that once married it&#39;s ok to start having babies.  But some of these poor bastards can&#39;t even financially support their newly acquired families.  Starving to death or dying from avoidable diseases and illnesses is something worse.  Imagine watching your child starve to death because you couldn&#39;t afford food?  Or die from meningitis, etc because you can&#39;t afford antibiotics...."
Is this the ‚Äúpagasa ng bayan‚Äù?
I really think these people need to do their research better . I‚Äôm filipino . Born and raised and I have never heard anything about that legal age of consent of 12 years old !
Rape with consent!!!!
Its not education alone that would solve the problem.The parents should know that they are responsible for their children.Teach your children and make rules in the house that must be followed.
"Other Filipinas: This.<br><br>Me: Gay, Introvert, Chilling in my sofa most of my miserable life, gaming and eating most of my time."

Kids having kids.. So sad. Kids holding babies instead of trucks and dolls!... My gosh the world has turned for the worst!
"I feel bad for my country, so many men seducing girls for pleasure, not knowing the big consequences afterwards."
The translation should have been better.
poor children...victims of poverty
it is really very depressing as a Filipino citizen knowing that it is happening in my country and im not even aware of it.
watching this video just makes me mad
Why do poor people and people that live in poverty breed like rats? They have so many children it&#39;s crazy
I feel like a lot of those girls are abused. Maybe some of them have Stockholm Syndrome :(
Puta nakakahiya
Do these girls have fathers
"They are following thier parents foot steps , producing babies."
Philiipines is a lil chocalate.

"They can say they should go to school. But we all know going to school will require ALOT of $$$ to pay to go to school. Lower class cannot afford to go to school. Middle class and upper clas has much more advantage to be in school. Come on, they could not even &quot;Throw&quot; that in this interview. Books cost lots of money, uniform and fees to sign up for school.If they offer free Public school for everyone, i think a lot more girls would be able to have a better chance to get a higher education. I came from a middle class family and still we were struggling in the Philippines to keep paying each year for school, shoes, uniform, books etc and food for the family. I am so thankful i am here in the U.S. and out of that cycle. And this documentary should understand why these people are poor and why they cannot go to school?"
Age of consent is 12!? WTH!!
Well that&#39;s just disgusting!!!!!
"I think, while this is an ongoing problem, we all should stop fingerpointing, because the Western world is not that much better. Even though most of the kids have the luxury of getting a propper education, there still are many, many teen-pregnancies. And all they have to do is to take birth control."
‚ÄúAge of the consent being 12‚Äù<br>That makes me sick.
"there is no such thing as legal age of consent here in the Philippines as it was repeatedly mentioned... the parents just turn a blind eye because of ignorance and poverty of which marrying their child would mean less mouth to feed... as we notice, they are even aware that men could be jailed by engaging into sexual activity with a minor... political will is also a problem when it comes to implementing the law, specifically RA 7610 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a>; mostly here in the Philippines girl children often resorted to engaging with much older men as their means to escape poverty or just simply to put food in their mouth without realizing long-term consequences"
hahahha wala ata akong nakita dito na nag comment ng im proud filipino....
My body kidneys and spine ached everytime i saw the young girls having babies and the adult boyfriends
disgusting
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipzwxXjAcA&amp;t=25m45s"">25:45</a> i hope they shut this place down!"
I don&#39;t think for sure the parents gave consent for the first couples husband because it was one less mouth to feed. They might want their daughter have a semblance of being dignified in a marriage and raising the family with the father. It&#39;s a Filipino thing
ARAL MUNA BAGO KANTOT
I thought duterte is going to stop this üòÇ

Contraceptives don&#39;t cause any harm .. What type of disbelief is that .. They don&#39;t provide people of their nation contraceptives while in my country you can find condoms in every wending machine
Condoms???
saklap
"I didn&#39;t even know there was a legal consent age, they never taught us what that meant, let alone that it was as low as 12 years old..."
Age of consent is 12? At that age you are afraid of telling your mum about your period? What is a 24 year old man seeing in a 12 year old.

Lack of legalized abortion is not the cause of this problem. It&#39;s the lack of education and the pedophile culture they have created.

Survival for catholic religion...
"Back when I was younger, we had this program at our school titled &quot;TRUE LOVE WAITS&quot; where we were educated to only give our purity to our husband/wife. We didn&#39;t even discuss anything about sexual intercourse, contraceptives, or what not. The difference from now and then is people are always in a rush. They would do everything to get what they want. Men would easily fool women by telling them that they would take responsibility if anything happens so long as they sleep with them. Then after learning the woman is pregnant, the man would ran away and look for another victim. A vicious cycle. A cancer that can no longer be treated. <br><br>Bottom line is...learn to wait and think a million times before making a huge decision."
"This is why Sexual Education is necessary. And not run by religious institutions (these incite prejudice, homophobia, ignorance etc abstinence isn&#39;t a solution) Why legal abortion is necessary. Why ignorance ISN&#39;T necessary."
The Filipino government has gone very wrong.
all these problems arise because they are in a circle of poverty
ikr. haha ang daming nagkalat na pamparegla sa quiapo lol
"I feel ashamed, as a person coming from this country. I feel lucky that I didn&#39;t experience this."

"When I was still a little kid my mom would tell me &quot;If u date at a young age and get pregnant. I will kick u out and never let u come back because, it means that ur already independent enough&quot;.<br>Now I&#39;m 13 but I never thought about dating tho, I always watch cartoons, focus on my studies and play with my cousins."

"Wow, that problem is out of control. Seems like lots of corruption in their government."
i was thaugth the birds and de beez at 12 now i know
"Religion is nothing more than mind control, they rather see these girls raped and dying than to educate a generation about preventive medicine and contraceptives"
"Everytime the goverment tries to do somethings, the church will counter attack it sad reality."
"Filipinos blames their Government, Church, US, Spain, China, Tsinoys and Unicorns, basically everyone except themselves for their demise."
"This is a example how relgion can be detrimental and why the phillipines has a population over a 100 million inhabitants. Logically speaking birth control is a method of limiting the amount of children, people would conceived. Furthermore more, the government is not doing enough to raise awareness of family planning."
"Filipinos needs a strong sense of Capitalism, they always blame the government for their misfortune but in reality their actions is what fails them."
"A clear example how they miss use god &amp; his way of good &amp; bad. Smh girls at a young age need to be taught without them men are nothing. I wish they were taught how beautiful they are &amp; don&#39;t take it so special when a guy says it. Many blessing for all these young girls who are victims without realizing or knowing, &amp; help them listen to their intuition when they feel something is wrong in a situation. Thank you to the people who are actually trying to help them. üòáüíù"
May God bless the Filipino girls. My heart bleeds for them.
"I got married at the age of 19 and got baby at 21@22 yrs old. But after that, I am determined to raise them well by not having baby again. Even though my ex-husband really wanted another one. I didn&#39;t agree unless he could provide enough food, shelter and good education for his children. We end up separated. Because he had cheated and marry another. Now he has another 2 sons. But I didn&#39;t marry another or having affers to anyone. I&#39;m focusing more on my childrens future. So I went abroad for work and until now, I&#39;m alone supporting my kids financially without the help of my ex-husband. Sad but true."
"s i g h...How deeply, DARKLY &amp; <b>profoundly</b> tragic...How will this cycle of hunger &amp; despair...repeated generation after generation after generation ever end???"

ignorance from the parents up to their children product of their corrupt govt.  after they achieved their so called freedom from their dictator
Religion ruins lives.
"dont they claim they have attained high literacy, higher even than 1st world countries?  what a joke...  so how can they claim not knowing?   they sell those abortion drugs in front of the church."
why am i not suprised that it is the men in power who are controlling what women do with their bodies. &quot;yes do not use contraception and get pregnant with many children!! no matter if you are 14 and your partner is 38&quot;
"Excuse me, I&#39;m a Filipino and 12 year old consent thing is not true.. I think they just got along with it because the girl is pregnant already. But saying filipinos are ok dating minors is an insult. That is not true!!!!"
These commercials are annoying!!

I mean yeah that 40 year old man was wrong for getting them prego, but it wasn&#39;t like they (parents) didn&#39;t care for her it was a choice (to stay with the dad) made for her and the baby&#39;s well-being. Who knows if the family had good income the girl even said she is fed better there, imagine the expenses of a newborn child as well. <br>That women needs to realize in any scenario that not every family has is much prosperous life... just like the ones starting out in here"

This is so sad and so sickening. I have a twelve year old son. He is barely responsible enough to remember to take out the trash without me asking. I couldn&#39;t imagine a child his age raising a child.
Hope Duterte can introduce no-child policy.
"Great to see slums of Pinas.   Should be given contraception at puberty.  Church is responsible for banning contraception.  Chinese style no-child policy only solution.   India may not be much better.    500,000 homeless from Kerala floods, while the whole population of Iceland is 300,000 rich people."

Age of consent 12? I&#39;m from the PH and I&#39;ve never heard of that... this is absolutely ridiculous.
our legal age of consent is 12? i seriously dint know that? I&#39;m betting you&#39;ve been misinformed.
These girls should stop watching romantic TV series and THINK about their future.
"The Philippine children are borned to serve the world for the rest of the world are killing their babies (by abortion). The Filipinos are needed by other countries as workers: nurses, engineers, maids, sailors, carpenters, farmers, servants, etc. God loves the Filipinos. You can see it in the smiles of the Philippine children in the midst of poverty. I am a proud  Filipino serving as a nurse in the USA."
That is the most disgusting way for these babies to have to live. I&#39;m sorry but it should be legal to give birth control implants in areas such as this.
Too many ads...booooooooo
"The catholic church is notorious for discouraging contraception and abortion. Never mind that these are pre-teen and teenage children getting raped and pregnant by their rapists! Catholicism seems to be operating on a destructive and disgusitng pattern: more babies, more tithers, more children who the priests can molest. The catholic church needs to be bankrupted at the soonest opportunity, and the pedophile priests need to be put into prison!"
I would kill my own baby
Start raising money for the girls to get <br>Birth control implant last 4+ years..Helps with overpopulation..Start receiving  then at 14 years old .
The age of consent is 12 ???? Please filipino people do something about it. It&#39;s 2018 for god&#39;s sake
"You know nothing about the Philipinnes, it&#39;s easy for you to judge and push your way of life, stupid libtards. There were successful lives before contraception. And you know that. It&#39;s a family and discipline issue. Racist brits working for Arabs."
this is supa random but i peeped a really cute filipino guy in the class LMAO sorry i‚Äôll go kms now
Catholicism + Filipinos hyper-sexual culture...!!Explosive mix
Yoooo couples for christ im in CFC-Youth
This country is so backward. Like how can you be a catholic nation but then be cool with children getting raped or pregnant or groomed? Then not allow any contraception? Kill people for petty crimes? Like this country has no redeeming qualities. I can see why the Chinese call it the trash of Asia.
Just use condoms...it doesn‚Äôt have to be drugs holy...
The white man has destroyed the entire earth with his lies &#39;WHITE JESUS CHRISTIANITY&#39;
"I dont know what to say but i felt sorry for them,im a Filipina also aged 34 but still single and no child huh.."
"I think forced family planning should be imposed. There should be a limit of how many children each one family have and raise the age limit ffs, are we living in Stone Age? 12? Really? That‚Äôs just mental.<br> Like China did 1 child policy. This may sound really harsh some people might not agree, but in my opinion population control is one of the top solutions for poverty control. Couples who can barely feed themselves makes 4 to 6 children. Irresponsible humans. Saga continues with their children as well, having a child while they are still a child themselves. Very sad."
"If anyone is wondering why abortion is illegal in the Philippines, it&#39;s because the Catholic church in our country is blocking any chance for a law to be passed. What&#39;s more, hardcore believers even condemns the usage of contraceptives since it &quot;kills&quot; potential babies. -_-"
"This is what a world looks like without the choice of abortion or birth control. Smh....this is children having children with no education and no money...forget about religion the truth is Philippines üáµüá≠ need to give young women options like abortion, free contraceptives and push educational attainment"
12 years old age of consent .. dating older men ok but don‚Äôt get pregnant!!! Where‚Äôs the logic????
This video inspired me to make a video about a light. A light that is in our country (philippines) and that light is always thier never left never stopped shinning even at night. But sadly alot of filipinos look at the problem they dont look at the light that is always there ready to help and just waiting for us. And i belive if we all see that light and continue to look at it we will all know our worth. We our not worthless we were paid with a price that no one else can pay and that is when jesus christ died for us on the cross more than two thousand years ago and whats amazing is that when he died he did not just stopped thier and just said &quot;ok i died already for you goodbye&quot; NO when jesus died in the cross for us he rose again and did not stop from helping us even now he is here with us he never left.<br><br>John 16 33<br>In this world you will have trouble or (burdens) BUT TAKE HEART I HAVE OVER COME THE WORLD.<br><br>my name is danielle and im only 14 and im a christian. Who loves to listen to hillsong and bethel and other awsome christian songs hope these words speaks to atleast 1 person.
"Sad to say this is very true in our country mostly in remote areas.  Women from poverty stricken families believe they could escape from hardships by forming a new family and having a partner to help them build better life. <br><br>AND ALSO once they were left by their partners,  it is not new to us that mothers would&#39;ve  wanted to find  a new partner again only to be left again and the cycle goes on. <br><br>Not conceive on next partner?  Girl there  ain&#39;t  no man who would&#39;ve  not want some of their own.  That makes them a man."
Why nobody&#39;s talking about what kinda government is it? That makes such laws where it is clearly noticeable that 12 years is certainly not an age to give consent. And why are people not trying to take such laws down?
"By God, the Catholic church and the State Education system has a lot to answer for. When will this indoctrination be outlawed and replaced by a real education? No wonder these people are in such poverty, dragged into this life with little hope. Children of 12 breeding like rabbits, afraid of the stigma that using contraception brings from the Catholic Church. They should start by booting out every single missionary and NGO that is against contraception, then start to remove all funding from the Catholic church. Disgusting."

"I want to say my piece without offending anyone, but the Filipino mentality of saying &quot;bahaha na ang diyos,&quot; it almost gave then an excuse to keep having babies because of the teaching &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; not realizing that if you have only a baby or two,  you can provide better for your family and feel blessed rather than to suffer and to struggle to make ends meet. To God be the glory."

"Obviously abstinence isn&#39;t working.  So instead of pushing abstinence, why not educate everyone (children and parents) and prosecute these men.  These young girls are so naive that these men are just taking advantage of it."
why peoples r so fanatic for their religion.religions r used by preachers to intoxicate innocent minds. peoples worship their god but they r not good in their life .

How about all the people in poverty that have no children or one or two! Not even Christians and yet all kinds of overtly there is no direct link between number of children and poverty?
it&#39;s a <b>BIG</b> problem here in the philippines and that&#39;s what cause poverty. it&#39;s not too late to solve this problem but the thing is with our government is corrupted and haven&#39;t really reconsider all the problems of our country. and this is one of them. it&#39;s really sad that this is our country&#39;s condition.

Legal pregnancy at the age of 12??? And legal age for contraceptive is  more than 18+ ?? Are you on weeds
And this is why there&#39;s even several single moms out there...messed up.

I dont know that my country contains some phedos or smthing. But this is true and it makes me sad for those girls who fell in love at an early age.
"This is too real, very upsetting"
"Kaya yan ang dahilan kung bakit di na uunlad yun Pinas, masiyadong maraming mga tao. Dami pang mga kawatan."
"I think this proves having children is not a human right but a right that you need to earn. If you can not guarantee your kids alimentation, safety, emotional estability (the parents to be would need to pass a phycological exam), then you should not be able to have kids. People would think my idea is extreme, but what those kids have to endure is way more extreme. They have to endure starvation, abuse, abandom, rape, cruelty, parents who blame them, they are sell sometimes. No kid should come to this world having to face such a horrible life just because their parents are too stupid to realize they cannot take care of them"
"Redel is my age, 43."
the religious institute and the government  is sick. The government wants the country to look more white so let&#39;s have these american and European white man come take advantage of your little girls. and abortion is not right because the Catholic church won&#39;t like that. self ethnic cleansing at its best.
12! some pedophile made that law he can diddle some kid and not goto jail for it
"Leave the people alone most of them have no problem with it so why should it be yours,I get  it they are young and shouldn&#39;t be having babies but most kids are having kids these days look at it,they are mostly 14-18 years old have kids these days and nobody isn&#39;t saying anything about so why you feel need to go to other country and stop what there doing and not doing anything to your own and then making kids doing abortion like isn&#39;t that bad for your body at such a young age"
Who want to GoFundMe to stop child age of consent at 12. This is legalized pedophile! Sick!
"IDK how I got to the dark side of youtube yet again but these are just really sad realities over in these countries. I&#39;m shocked the age of consent is 12 and even though it&#39;s legal from what they say most of them their first time is actually rape even though it&#39;s not a struggle it still is what it is. I feel for these women and young girls. I have seen many other countries struggle and this is why people try to come over here for a better life. We&#39;re becoming overpopulated here but can you blame them for trying to make it over here I know I would. It should just be part of life for them to be put on an iud or something long lasting at 12 then if this is what&#39;s going to happen to them. I hate saying that but this is just horrible. I can&#39;t imagine life like this even the hospital there is no privacy, no ac, overcrowding and not that sanitary looking. I am grateful for the life I have and maybe this is why I end up watching these videos. I should just stop complaining about my petty problems and be happy with what I have."

Islam and Catholic religion do not support for contraceptives
"Honestly, it&#39;s not just about religion (and not just Catholicism). The problem is the lack of education, the irresponsability of the (too young) parents who don&#39;t raise their children properly and don&#39;t put education/children&#39;s future first, which leads to a never-ending cycle of poverty... religion is just an excuse."
The philippine government and stupid political dynasties do not want a long term solution. Instead giving and generating more jobs politicians preffer to give alms coz those way they generate a lot of sympathy and of course votes. These votes are the one keeping them in power and also hope for a better future is what politicians see as generating votes.
"Why do phillipinos (Is that how you spell it?) look so old??? This isn&#39;t an insult or anything, I&#39;m just incredibly curious because Japanese and Koreans always look so young?

Let those churches feed those kids
This is just wrong
Since the Catholic Church refuses to allow birth control THEY should be the ones who pay!!! GET THESE WOMEN BIRTH CONTROL!!!
"Jobless, poverty, over populated, lack of self control, etc etc"
Look at this Chinese reporter...speaking from the #1 overpopulation in the world...CHINA.
"See, religion is stupid."
"I guess that debunks the myth that 11 year old girls can have babies.  11 year olds can have babies.  It&#39;s just a question now of whether that is moral or immoral, legal or illegal, right or wrong...."

That&#39;s sobering and I know I have to wrap it up because I was born to a teen mom and grew up in dire straits
Strange how it is it always the most pathetic and self destructive countries are always tied heavily to religion. ü§î
"Ive lost hope for this country, i dont even know how philippines gonna get back right up."
"The Philippines, Exhibit A for why the logic of anti abortion nutcases is just pure nuts. I&#39;m talking about the ones we have in the the US of A here. By and large, in today&#39;s world its always the poor and undereducated who have far more children than they can take care of, continuing the cycle of poverty. I&#39;ve walked through putrid Manila slums. Trust me, you wouldn&#39;t want to live there."

My mom would be proud of me coz Im just here in the  house slouching in the couch and eating some potato chips
Age of consent is 12? Is this the legal consent? I got married at 23 and my parents have to sign a verbal consent with the local office... And I am a Filipina.
"The only up side... is that some of these guys are taking care of their children, which is not what I&#39;d expect."
What&#39;s wrong with these idiot&#39;s
Having a miscarriage is a sin... omg
11 years old.... 7 months pregnant..... 22 year old boyfriend..... smh üòëüòê
The president should do a shooting practice there.
Stupid Governor. Give the kids the right education to prevent poverty in the Philippines. Our country is a baby factory. Can you see that?
Age of consent 12 and it is not appropriate to talk about contraceptive or hiv test to parents before turning 18. <br>This is insane .
State approved pedophilia...
"I am disgusted by the government systems in these countries... It is so depressing to the results of poor education and heavy religious belief... Failed government systems should not be sustained and prolonged when the side-effects are so prominent and devastating for the communities they govern... I disagree wholeheartedly with conservative pro-lifers, and I hope to assist in the shift required for a good quality of life."
"A condom is not going to cause permanent damage. At least use that. Yes there are risks to using birth control, every woman‚Äôs body is different. Some women take it for years and are able to get off of it and still conceive and vice versa."
Kalibugan lang yan lol
you try to say these people are pacific islanders
I dont know if I should carry on moving to the Philippines anymore
Stupid. Well keep making starving babies fools.
why always feature bad news in the Philippines they are only few cases in the Philippines why always target the poverty of manila
I hope that dog gets food to üò•üê∂
to be honest as a filipino myself i didnt know that the age of consent is 12??
"There is a law in the PH that there should be separation between the church and state, as respect to other religions.<br>And, HUMAN LIFE WILL BE USELESS IF THEIR PARENTS CAN&#39;T SUSTAIN THEM."
Wait what? Im from the Philippines and i didn&#39;t know its that teen pregnancy is legal here...
Just punch em in the stomach
awww poor Josephyn :(
I thought 18 is the age of consent in my country
manny Paco
This is more than high way ROBBERY EVEN ROBBERY IT SELF!! TALK ABOUT THE  CATHOLIC CHURCH  I WONNA SCREAM THE HE&#39;LL OUT ü§§ü§ïüò†üò°üò°üò°üò°
And then religious zealots pushing anti abortion laws.
#NAME?
Wala bang condom sa pinas?!?!
PEDOPHILES ! Wtf
That&#39;s how also poverty increase in a high level. I hope things change there.
"still think &quot;It&#39;s More Fun in the Philippines&quot;?<br><br><br><br><br><br>yes, i am filipino and i hate my country."
The poor and uneducated are easier to control by the church and the government.  THAT is the real reason why NONE is being done about this problem.  Overpopulation IS a problem.  A BIG ONE.
"Can someone tell me why dafuq it costs 35,000 dollars to adopt a baby from here when you could literally open a dumpster and find one for free"
As I understand there is no 12 yrs old consent to MARRY in the Philippines!
This is too much EXAGGERATED
ohh god
Catlicks have a lot to answer for.
Teenage Pregnancy is our topic in Health
"Stop listening to white, pale and peeled people..Isaiah 18:2,7<br>[2]That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!<br>[7]In that time shall the present be brought unto the YAHH of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the YAHH of hosts, the mount Zion."
"This is so heart breaking,"
They need sexual education here very desperately !
The girl is such a sweet innocent angel she&#39;s been through so much and she takes all the blame :(
No need to blame the church because they did not tell them to procreate at a very young age. The parents has to be blame because it is their responsibility to teach their children about the consequences of having or bearing a baby at very young age.
"QUESTION? How the heck are you worrying about aborting babies but yet you can no nothing for the kids you let live such as feed them, school them. Also, why the he&#39;ll isn&#39;t there a law against older men preying on these younger girls?"
People blame the lack of education but even the education system sucks.<br><br>Glad I‚Äôm Gay
"I&#39;m a Filipino, and I&#39;ve no idea that the age consent was 12. Back where I come from, teenage pregnancy is extremely frowned upon, and you must be at least the age of 20 or higher to be married. <br><br>This was bit of a surprise. An unpleasant one."
"upside is...they have a lot of work force, hence the rise in their economy..20 years time, they would be a serious global competitor: SO WHO WENT AGAINST THE RH BILL AGAIN?? oh yeah the fuckwits who want poverty.. poverty = desperation =church(salvation) = influence = politics = money...PERIOD"
Kaya tayo nag mumukhang mababa para sa ibang bansa dahil mamimili nalang kayo ng i f- feature about sa Pilipinas mga ganyan pa.
"My goodness how these mother can able just give, and giving birth.. It&#39;s gives me, goosebumpsüëçüëç<br>Lack of sexual education regarding contraception..<br>More and more baby how do they feed those children while some of them are from slum areas and poor families..<br>The male partner has also responsible to control and female must have knowledge not allowed themselves to hve more and more babies.."
Legal age of consent is 18 years old
Is it illegal to give the babies up for adoption to?
That sucks that someone with religious beliefs is in control over something so serious and yet they don&#39;t help people in need but want them to have as many babies as possible
"We need a people that can Educate them now! I wiill help them when I  can and become ready...IGNORANCE ARE NOT BLESSED.  There is still a way for this poverty, Government is not the solution, your family or neighboor is either not the solution too...IKAW lng ang makakatulong sa sarili mo, Ikaw lng ang makakapagdecide pra sa sarili mo. Marami p rin oportunidad sa paligid mo kailangan mo lng alamin sila, God already give all you need, kailangan mo lang gawin ang obligasyon at magsikap. Wag ka magtrabaho sa pera, magtrabaho ka para sa isang kasanayan na makakatulong syo. Kapag may kasanayan kana madali na maghanap ng pera. Lagi mo prin unahin c God sa lahat ng gagawin mo."
"Eww, these guys are disgusting. They know better and still are hopping on teenage girls and bringing kids into a world where they can&#39;t afford"
Filipinos are clueless people. Get a clue Filipinos.
Filipinos need to be educated. Ano na ang dapat nating gawin mga kapwa pinoy?
maganda yung babae hawig ni kathryn bernardo pag nakatagilid
I really hate the Catholic Church in the Philippines because they interfere in all things which the government is doing to make the country better but the Catholic Church will always deny to things which are prohibited in the Bible.
I don&#39;t feel bad for those people at all. I feel bad only for the animals I&#39;ve seen. you can be poor and clean. and you can be poor and seek knowledge. you can ask your doctor how pregnancy works. I don&#39;t feel bad for them at all.

I really think that it‚Äôs not about the religion but the lack of education for the people. Government needs to step up the education system here in the Philippines real soon.
"This documentary need to check their facts. San nila kinuha ang ang 12 ang age of consent? Under Philippine law age of consent is 18, You can give consent to marry at the age of 18.Even the age of criminal liability is 15 and above subject to certain condition. However, If a rape and seduction victim marries the perpetrator it relieves the latter of criminal liability."
"You cannot blame it only on church, you can also blame it on lack of education and information, blame it to parents who just push their daughter to dead end, blame it to teenagers who don&#39;t think twice or thrice. People have choices it just that they always pick the fun one but they don&#39;t know it become hard when kids come along especially when the partner left them for another girl. üòë"
"Dear people of the world, especially to the Americans and Europeans. This is not what all Filipinos look like. This is only what the media keeps showing to the world. Not all of us are poor. Not all of us are domestic helpers. Not all of us have countless children and siblings. Not all of us are short. So keep the insults to yourselves.<br><br>Many of us are actually well educated. In here we are all required to finish college. No degree, no worthwhile job. We have many doctors, engineers, architects and etc. Many of us live in comfort. Even those who live in the provinces, many of them live in comfortable neighbourhoods. Why do you think many of your senior citizens retire here? Please do not underestimate us just because of what you see here.<br><br>Though it is a fact that the poor people here keep squirting out kids who they can&#39;t feed thus continuing their cycle of poverty. That is something I believe to be the fault of the government and the catholic church here."
me being 25 thinking about not having babies at all
"After interviewing the students, one of them said: some can&#39;t control themselves so he is for contraception...then the problem is self control....what do you do to overcome the urges? Go to church,  practice your faith...watch what you feed your mind and what you engage in."
"Where are the parents? It&#39;s time for ppl to be accountable for their own actions..stop blaming the Church. These are grown men preying on young girls..young girls aren&#39;t adults yet to be able to make their own decisions..and parents need to parent their children. Parents are #1 to blame. Children&#39;s first education starts at home, father be good father and provider, mothers need to raise and teach their children so they grow up responsible adults. ABORTION IS AND WILL NEVER BE THE ANSWER..do not make that mistake just coz you don&#39;t want the responsibility. Have your baby adopted."
grosss
"The catholic church says its immoral to use contraceptive, but it is ok  to produce babies even though they knew they can&#39;t raise them.. prone to abuse, neglect, drug abuse, trafficking:.........the catholic religion of the romans (not christian) is one of the biggest cancer of the Philippines"
"I wish a Philippine lawmaker can see this documentary, the legal age of consent it too low yet to buy a condom u have to be 18."
Other people from other country who can see this video might say and judge that filipinos really like this. Not all folks! Still plenty are smart and educated. Not living in slum.
"Ang totoo ang pilipinas ay napaka konserbatibong bansa..nang dahil sa pag evolve ng mundo,media,kahirapan,yun ang nagiging dwell ng mga tao..kawalan ng edukasyon number 1 yan na factor baket dumadami Ang ganito sa pilipinas."
Those teenagers look like kids themselves üòü
Catholic Church always said &quot;Go and Multiply&quot; Without educating people That was Stupidity.
"The Bible said you have to marry before you have children, true it doesn&#39;t say anything about the age. We should educate and protect these children."
"We are 8 siblings in the family, I‚Äôm the eldest. My parents doesn‚Äôt know about birth control and also my mother got allergy of pills and afraid of needles, so no way of stopping having a baby. we went through a very rough life so I told myself I don‚Äôt want to have same family in the future. I‚Äôm 37 now I have 1 son turning 18yrs old just him don‚Äôt want another baby I want to give to my son a good future. the problem now here in the philippines üáµüá≠ I think the children are very exposed to temptations thru theirs friends bad influence. I hope they will listen to their parents or just see around how bad the situation being a young mother, making 1 mistake is enough and try to stand and correct the mistake not to add another one."
I can&#39;t!!
"What kind of plans have the proponents of world population reduction for societies, such as the  Philippines ? Sterilization or atomic incineration ?"

Poverty problems can be seen. The government is to blame and social environment. (please help the people).<br>Why not try to help each other in teen to teen conversation and social after school activities amongst each other.

I am a truble child but thanks to a good education I had my first child after I  got married. I thank my self for being so strong... I love children I wanted early a child and then realized I first need to be stable be able to offer me a steady life and have built up a life to be ready to be able to bring a child in a healthy and happy environment.<br><br>Sadly the truth is:  education is the key to life. <br>Corinne

who cares what it cost the gov&#39;t. It is the gov&#39;ts fault for not taking care of their people the leaders are greedy crooks and should trickle their riches to the people  higher pay. Free schooling and trades training. There should be free contraceptives

"Funny thing. This slum areas are beneficial to the government because the more &quot;Barangays&quot; they can made out of them.. the more voters on elections and new &quot;Kapitan&quot; they would get as officials. They don&#39;t really want to get rid of those. also some of those who have given &quot;Housing relocations&quot; has abused the loophole of going back to slum areas, get census by the government and given another &quot;Housing relocations&quot; and various benefits. Theres no simple solution politically here as the government is incapable. The first step is to educate this people about family planning"
"The ignorance is so infuriating. If contraception is so hard to get and they shun sexual education because of the influence of the church, then the government needs to CHANGE THE AGE OF CONSENT!! <br><br>Getting pregnant at 11 by a boyfriend who&#39;s AN ADULT is disgusting. Why isnt the boyfriend in jail if she got pregnant at 11 and the age of consent is 12. The slums of Manila are so poverty stricken, why TF are people having babies when the family already can barely feed themselves. If they insist on putting such young girls through the trauma of labor on an underdeveloped body, give the baby up for adoption! And the girl who got pregnant again just a few weeks after giving birth at just 16??? So dangerous and just plain stupid. Parents need to educate their dumbass kids."

"There is an overpopulation crisis in the world. There should be an international law: if you cannot support yourself, you should not have ANY children!! It is disgusting that kids are having kids, bringing them to life to live among trash..and all the prostitution there, a factory of mixed fatherless children!! What kind of country is that??? Thailand, the same!! People there, make a radical change, you are just digging your own grave!"
Yes it is true... just go outside your house and there is already a tonne of kids on the street... but contraceptive or abortion is not the solution. But having exemplary morals. Abstain. Focus on studies. Do the deed after marriage when you are of legal age. No unwanted pregnancy and no STDs.
Mas lalo mawawala Ang respeto ng innocenteng lalaki dahil lng sa manyak na lalaki
"Making this about the right to contraception is a highly politically motivated spin. Instead of talking about how the punishments for rape need to be more severe. Almost all of the girls were not only extremely young, but they also made it clear that it was not consensual. More focus should have been on preventing this kind of life altering trauma, rather then trying to simply get rid of or prevent the conception of a child that might be the product of such acts. This just gives the man more freedom to force himself on anyone he wants without societal pressure of any kind towards him since his sin will now be well hidden."

Truly Baby Factory - It looks like they don&#39;t think before they let it happen. They are aware that they don&#39;t have the best quality of life but they give birth to babies they can&#39;t afford to raise them.

"Interesting stuff, as a travelogue.  But why do you term the Philippines a &quot;baby factory&quot; when most women here are now having just 2 or 3 children at most?  Why don&#39;t you instead apply that term to the the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, or its neighbors, where the typical woman has 5 or 6 children?  Just curious.  Was it just easier -- and more &quot;politically correct&quot;  --   to pick on a Catholic Christian country, rather than on an Islamic African country?  Or maybe the Philippines is just simply more fun for your film crew to visit?  PS How were the beaches in Palawan?"
Wow. I hope they dont mistaken for the babies belong to?
But she said was a high price for goverment. But i think in this countrys countrys dont help in nothing this? Is not like in europe. Here in UK they even have children to get money from goverment. There they dont help. Even in portugal there is very little help from goverment if he have children.

"Good thing, I never learned to play Chinese garter."
Throw them 1000000 condoms
Catholic mentality is really hard to break and accept others ideas

"Im not being mean or maligning family with little or no income at all,  but if these family only thought of staying with one or two kids with 5 to 10 yrs age gaping,  life would be better for them.. Unfortunately poor families also has abundant children in tow making it a viscious cycle of hardlife for them repeating the misfortune of the parents to their kids... üò∞üò∞üò∞"
The legal of consent here is 18 NOT 12!
Man my mom‚Äôs home is crazy I lived a year here and really haven‚Äôt seen this much
why always people blame the governer the president or God....if its people bad choices tha they make to live like that
The problem is the Chruch and religious beliefs taking over the country.
I am devastated watching this :(
Educate poor Filipino families!
Age of consent 12? No wonder it&#39;s a pedophile tourist destination. Absolutely disgusting
this appears paedophilic. It is revolting.
I think Chinese graters is the culprit.
masarap kasi magkantutan....
thank you that was so well done
Mga makakating matandang lalaki.. dapat sainyo mamatay. Kadiri kayo. Minamanipula mga batang babae para makipagsex. Pakshit rin ung religion.. full of bs. 2000 yrs old na bibliya at quran nyo. Outdated mga gawa ng mga middle east pedo.
Ang lalandi kasi e.. madalas dito lalaki nagpupush makipagsex. Mga makakati.. mga pasikip pahirap sa pinas.
A CATHOLIC PRAYING TO A FALSE GOD BEFORE PERFORMING BORTION..HARD TO BELIEVE BUT VERY COMMON IN THE PHILIPPINES.
He&#39;s definitely not 28 ...He&#39;s a liar.  Just like he knew her age. Smh
28? Wtf
No matter how poor their existence is in that part of the world they all seem to have 5 kids each.¬† Why if your barely existing would you want¬†children ¬†to join in that misery?
Why the age of consent so young this blows my mind
I hate how religion interferes with health and how people can take care of themselves.
"Birth control has side effects she was told, but living in filth n around human waste is safe right. I guess the kids with the swollen bellies who have worms is safe. These girls are dumb."
Population is indeed the main cause of poverty.
omg someone‚Äã adopt that 13-year-old girl üò¢
How can we help and bring awareness and education? How can we be the change?
Overpopulation is an issue? Puts age of consent at 12 and age to be able to buy contraception at 18. Yeah that makes sooooooo much sense. I mean seriously who runs this country.
this world is really getting worse
its more fun in the Philippines
The poor babies!!!
The age of consent is only 12. This is one of the reasons foreigners who like children come here. It is so wrong. It needs to be changed.
Sadly disturbing.
Legal age 12 ?! That‚Äôs awful...awful....awful
both are cruel...having too many population will lead to poverty and crime or abortion is the only choice if it is legalized. the only non cruel way is condom on always
this is crazy ! condoms needed to be handed out by the government to prevent  these pregnant teens. They need to see this is a crisis that religion cannot fix and thinking so is like putting your head in the sand ?  this is similar to what&#39;s  happening In poor areas in Africa.. lets get the birth rate down and not contribute to it...
when a country can&#39;t provide for it&#39;s own.. the women should be made to get the shot or injection¬†so as¬†not to have more children.. that should be a free service too... cause not all people are rich..
"Wow, ignorance at its finest, worshiping false gods mixed with corrupted politics. pathetic.  The fat guy preaching to the teens and the teenage girl who said &quot; i wont use contraceptive because i am catholic &quot; really need to get slapped with a frying pan. knock some sense into these idiots. PATHETIC! why does this country even exist on the map?"
Worst country- Philippine?
Don&#39;t they sell condoms in convenience store? Indonesia is a muslim majority country but condoms are easily accessible.
CBCP must watch this
The rh law is soo not implemented well üòíüòí
Children having children and parents consent because it&#39;s one less mouth to feed. Other men taking advantage of the situation so they can have young fresh bait. Where can I start?;seeing ALL the teenagers sharing a bed with their newborn made me sick to my stomach.
"I totally disagree with the church on this. Being able to plan child birth is key to a happy and successful life for both parents and children. And that, in turn, is the key to health and prosperity. Early childbirth is the biggest thing that is holding the Philippines back."
Catholicism does the Philippines good.
alhamdulillah I was born muslim
I think that woman is really out of line trying to have the men locked up. Especially if the man is taking care of the children.
bunch of horney undisciplined individuals
&#39;Age of consent 12&#39; is sadly and unfortunately true. Thankfully The National Youth Commission of Philippines has urged Congress to prioritize a measure that would raise the age of sexual consent from 12 to 16. Fingers ü§ûüèæ
"12, really!!!! I was playing dolls at that age/I didn‚Äôt even have my period yet, I need to learn more about this!!!"
That little girl is smiling but she actually wanted to cry.. üòÇüòÇ peace to my own country
thsi country is sooo far off the standards of the West we should not give visa&#39;s to this off the world place
That fool in the school was a fool and i am sorry but these people are foolish when it comes to the beliefs of the catholic church and child bearing i am catholic but an atheist to  and this is complete rubbish these girls are brain washed by the church......
Libog Problems should be tought to boys ahhaha
You either believe in birth control or you are in support of abortion that is the reality of it.
"Government and public officials in the  Philippines in general are corrupt,,together with the hypocrite catholic church.."
"These beautiful girls with these ugly men, crude reality tho ü§∑."
The 2nd girl was helped by Mark Nowhereman you can find it on his channel (named the same) a few years ago. Pretty said she chose to do that. And how stupid of the parents as that house is her parents (seen in his video).
"2018 - Illegals are being separated temporarily from parents at the US border. Leftists are using the emotional image politically. They ARE NOT demanding that DNA tests be done to PROVE that small children are in fact with parents. They may have been kidnapped off the streets, or sold by their parents. Testing is painless and cheap, and rather quick these days."
"That abstinence lesson using a microphone to explain male and female anatomy meanwhile teenagers think contraceptives are dangerous, are giving birth at alarming rates, and can&#39;t even finish high school because the of the burden of childrearing..."
Stop just stop disgusting
That dog looks so sad 9.21
WTF WHY IS THE AGE OF CONSENT 12
It&#39;s because this country is blinded by a stupid thing called religion. That&#39;s why.
Corrupt government officials  + Religious meddling in state affair + Irresponsible parents + Lack of economic opportunity + Lack of proper education = Cycle of extreme poverty &amp; ignorance
"Without  a full education for both boys and girls, they will forever be poor and dependent on others for food and clothing even shelter.  Education is the best route to go.  Don&#39;t have any babies ever!"
Western  feminist care  more about pronouns than the lives of these girls...they want free birth  control mean while these girls  cant get it till their  18...
This is one of the saddest things I&#39;ve ever seen. You can see all the pain and hurt in these little girls eyes. And what kind of parent is that no matter how poor you were when someone does that to your daughter and you&#39;re like oh it&#39;s cool cuz they&#39;ll take care of her in the baby. You shouldn&#39;t want somebody like that (predator) around your kid whether they&#39;ll pay for them or not.  You can&#39;t see how sad your child is and broken?!!!? I wish I could hug all these girls and help them and just tell him that it&#39;s not their fault.
He doesn‚Äôt look 38 yrs old ü§î

Do they not know what the pullout method is

"Whaaaat? Shes 11 and her boyfriend is 22? I mean what is this? 12 years as the age of consent is unbelievable OMG. At 11years old me i was not even paying attention to boys, i was too busy going to school, hanging with my friends, playing dolls and watching cartoons...<br>Yassus! Something not happening around you doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt happen anywhere elseüòûüòû"
At 13 all I want to do is collect anime figures and mangas. good thing suportado naman ako ni mama at papa. lol. I prefer collecting them than boyfriends AHAHAH!!

This is not a common practice in the Philippines Al Jazeera exaggeration to make money .? Every 3rd world country has this problem or worse .
"OMG, the condenscending and ignorant attitude of that NGO worker. I vomitted."
I live in the Philippines kamusta
Poor poor babies. They live like animals. Disgustingüò¢
"This isn&#39;t right at all, I&#39;m a filippina and I cannot believe that there is some provinces that are in my home country having a baby in a young age, I really hope that the president and also the government fixed this. Even though now I lived in Canada and consider as a half canadian and filippino I still really care about my country because that&#39;s where I was born and glad to have my parents have this situation before they were young.<br><br> I was born in Manila and when I saw this video it really shocked me because I have no idea where Palawan is. And I feel so embarrassed to other people that are from a different country they&#39;re born to see this. (TBH also don&#39;t make fun of me, I actually can&#39;t remember anything about my country)"
Al Jazeera seems to be targeting Philippines for negative news quite a bit
7 billion people in this world and the catholic church still insists on the abstinence bullshit. Even their own priests can&#39;t celibate themselves. Isn&#39;t that why many of their own turn to touching little kids. Disgusting garbage.
The catholic church should set aside some charity funds from their pedophile restitution payments to help care for all these babies they advocate to be reproduced in masses.
Sad for the children.... when you told them its a sin to use births control or protection.... just England alone killed 18 million chicken a day for food and wonder who save the chicken....
&quot;Abstinence is the only way&quot;<br><br>THIS IS SO BOTHERING.
"&quot;She said&quot;:..., (... but the woman/reporter says something else, not WHAT &quot;she said&quot;... )"

"Ain&#39;t they supporter of Barak Obama  what do he has to say about it .I did not vote cause I believe in every word of God and my money shall not support wrong ,cause God say what you pay triubte to. What you give money to it what you support  .your taxes pay for these   things that the goverment ok ."
That&#39;s a sad reality üòé
That is why the white man go over there and that black man go over there. these people will be punished for the pain they are putting on these girls. Than they want the ones who has money help with the children the rich.
God rain his  hands on the wicked. I pray that these girl will be helped  this is rape no matter how they are covering it up it is in Gods eye rape.
"As long as you use your brain, you never got pregnant"
Females have no significant value to their families and are looked as a costly defect to the household unless the parents can get her married off to an expat / foreigner in hopes that he will give them money every month.
So much clinging to ignorance
Ang lilibog nyooo... una libog talaga vago buhay!  Nakakahiya!
"It&#39;s like they don&#39;t even want the women using protection. Every women kept saying &quot;people told me I would be allergic&quot;, like??? The fact that some people in this country are against protection is BEYOND me considering the poverty and struggle."
Shocking beyond comprehension
Blame this all in the Church !!!!¬† the government been trying to stop the population explosion in the Philippines by introducing birth control methods but¬†the Church keeps on interfering with all their BS.....so who&#39;s ¬†suffering now ??????????
This is what happens to a country that eats too much Pagpag
"IT&#39;S not America&#39;s fault, to provide condoms, let the Vatican State provide it."
"Due to the fact that people are forced to be conservative, they often feel supressed therefore curiosity will hit them, and they&#39;ll try &quot;new&quot; things. It has to do with our religion being so strict all the time, and the fact that majority of the schools are catholic schools, make it worse. The age of consent in the philippines is 18, but there are alot of teenagers getting pregnant earlier than that bc of the lack of education in SexEd. DepEd wanted to institute the subject in the education&#39;s curriculum, but since there are a lot of catholic schools, they can&#39;t perform the task of implementing it. Plus there are a lot of teens that are &quot;nagmamagaling&quot;"
"6 yrs not enough for those selling abortion! 60 yrs to life seems better! Or, just slit their throats; probably much cheaper!"
"Strong Religious opposition by the Philippine Catholic Church... many filipinos are scared of the church...<br><br>Failing to realise that reproductive health and sexuality education will help alleviate poverty...<br><br>The whole country‚Äôs conservative attitude is very old-school.. medieval to be honest... as compared to predominant religious countries like Spain, Ireland, etc..."
The president of the philippines needs to help these poor people and hold the population for a bit.
What&#39;s wrong with the girl in blacks eyebrows tho
What the social worker do in the Philippines. They don&#39;t educate young people. They should go house to house
I notice that most young Filipino girls who get pregnant are poor and have a lack of parental guidance. The problem stems from the lack of parental guidance. I pity my fellow Filipinos. I do hope we get to solve the problem.
In manila some informal settlers is like that and also in mountainous area
Actually it also depends on their parents cause if they have care for their child they won&#39;t let their daughter to have a boyfriend at such a young age just like my parents did they are so over protective
"This video might be disturbing, but it&#39;s the ugly truth."
The government is useless

Sickening! People are just not bothered about God and His commandments. This is why the country is suffering.
The age of consent in the Philippines is 12 years old per the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 a.k.a. Republic Act 8353 but the legal age ( age of majority) is 18 as amended in the Family Code of the Philippines Article 234 of Executive Order No. 209. <br><br>These are two very different things.
you guys always create a documentary about poor people. But you are not doing anything about it.
i understand poverty but I&#39;m not rich but I&#39;m clean!!! these people just live in absolute sqauler ....they cant pick up the trash??? maybe it would give them some hope and clarity to be able to live somewhere they are proud of and be clean...this is just a disgrace
Strange I‚Äôm confused .
"I&#39;m so thankful to my parents that they raised me well and even though we&#39;re not wealthy, but we&#39;re wealthy in other way like  love and care."

Where did we learn Catholicism? From those fcktrads who enslaved our people for 300 years.  Doctor Jose Rizal himself don&#39;t belive in such religion because of what he experienced or saw from that time.
wow.. this is scaryy

"some of these women are on phones, I know they can look up how to prevent pregnancies ,  stupidity at its finests"
The catholic church dont want abortions because they want all these poor folowers (sheeps) that feeds its baskets daily tidings.
The Church and the goverment should come together to solve this problem. Philippines is a beautiful country and their people was so kind. So sad to see this happen
"Makinis, maputi sya pero bakit ganun?"
pinaghahawakan kc nila ung &quot;humayo kayo at magpakarami&quot; eh sinbi ln ni God sa panahon nila adan at eva dhil wla pang msydong tao ngaun panahon na ng chirstianity ngaun .. I think theres nothing wrong about using contraceptive hnd ka nmn pumapatay ng bata s gamot n un ..

‚ÄúAll life is good‚Äù meanwhile duterte is killing peeps. I believe in deitys and god but I don‚Äôt believe in religion and I know the commandments and if you know what the commandments are you should know that what duterte is doing is wrong.
These churches are the root of poverty!!!! Sad but truth!!!!
Kay plaiyot mo tagam!
Because those poor people don&#39;t have knowledge about family planning . most of them want to have more babies and yet they cannot support them financially
"stfu you baby killers <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23abstinence"">#abstinence</a> is the only way"

This wrong the parents why have you forsaken the child is young and have husband and baby not going schooling crazy the parents
"Good , live us alone,imagine  the world  without  children, no to kiss ,no to say  Inay and Tatay ,Tia or Tio, Get out in the Philippines  spread  you propaganda  somewere  else, get lost , go were you belong. <br>"
weird culture!! need to be cautious.
"Not giving them the right to plan their family and not giving them an option not to have baby at early age is making  them more evil. So, the stupid church is creating more evil. No family planning means abortion and poverty which may lead to thief, rape, murder and etc."
I wish I could help the girls üòî
"so the democrat white women think its better to have the father arrested, how would that be better for the girl?"
WTF Philippines! Raise the age of consent!!!!
They need to be educated by their parents and sometimes children are stubborn and don&#39;t listen to their parents.
Exact opposite of japanese where there is too little baby born.
"So many of them in Australia, NZ, and everywhere else in the world"
All this suffering because of a stupid religion. Heartbreaking to see these young girls lives ruined.
Disturbing.
"God this makes me so mad and sad, so many of my pinsan have gone thru early pregnancy due to so many factors. They lack birth control, they won‚Äôt use condoms, partly from religion and because of the cultural issues, and poverty. They think it‚Äôs good to have babies but then this screws up the females chances to finish college and work and have a real career. And don‚Äôt forget that it‚Äôs the children that raise and care for the elderly parents."
My mother get pregnant when she was 18 years old.
Oh boy... sexual education need to start at an early age. If the Catholic Church forbids conceptive the catholic-church should be handing out money to them. It‚Äôs a bigger sin to bring a life into this world and have them suffer.
I blame the religious churches.
In few years I think I will adopt one baby from there .....
&quot;Abstinence &quot; üòÇ this is 2018 bro!
This is why the church should never influence the state.

"Ignorance is a common problem. The problem in our country, the Philippines, is that some schools aren&#39;t promoting sexual education, even some parents take this topic as Taboo. A person&#39;s lack of knowledge and self responsibility can really put the country&#39;s name to shame."
Omg what the f@(k   at 12 years old
Some of these men on here need to be in jail!
Absolutely appalling that a government accepts this as right!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
"Sad state of affairs.üò¢<br>The Government and the Church must do more to prevent this torture to the future generations. Family planning is the key. More emphasis should be laid on education of the girls. Raising the age of consent to 18 should be done asap.<br>The Philippines is a lovely country. And the Filipinos are a wonderful people. The current Filipino President, His Excellency Rody Duterte, is the apt person to help bring about this sea change in demography. To save the future generations, he must do everything to bring limit teenage pregnancy and check the burgeoning population.<br>God bless the Phillipines.<br>God bless His Excellency."

I hate it
Sobrang dami talagang problema ng putang inang bansang to.
It seems the Catholic religion is doing more harm than good in Philippines. But that&#39;s just my opinion.
"Once again, Western views are destroying a nation. Good thing Duterte is in office."
Abortion is illegal but letting your baby starve to death because the father leaves is okay??? Omg
the phillipine govt will have to bring in a law stating that cannot marry till 25 &amp; women 22 &amp; one child only otherwise overpopulation which brings poverty will get worse
"Population should be controlled in the Philippines.  As it sits geographically in the ring of fire, food production is the lowest in South East Asia.  The government by no means subsidise food production or support any food program for these children.  Moreso, the government and its political leaders allow the Catholic Church to intervene with family planning and personal choices."
Pedophile heaven. Philiphile.
The country where people questioning the RH bill.. Specially the people of the Catholic church.. But look at this..
I&#39;m really glad my grandmother left the Philippines because I&#39;m 13
Both of these women are not wearing wedding bands and Swanepoel generated some interesting smiles from the two girls she had working for her.  I wonder why they happened to be so young and beautiful?  Would it not have seemed more appropriate for her to be employing one of these women that were trapped by men and motherhood?
It&#39;s 18 y.o. not 12 years old for consent age! Where did they get this wrong information?
Its true but every country has its own problem its funny how people reacted to much. Even they have they&#39;re own problem we filipinos smile even its hard for us we accept the reality. Thats why we have this sayings &quot;family first&quot; there are more countries that need more attention lol. This documentary is the beautiful bad side of the philippines.
Religion must be stop its 2018 already
"first of all, there&#39;s too much ads"
who care how old they are my husband is 15 years older then me im 27 and he is 42
What are the ages of consent in this channel headquarters and the surrounding countries?.
"Honestly, if people focus on career instead of love, and social prejudice, pregnancy rates would go down so much (i like working and I am someone who likes to work on my own, get rich and be my own thing, and I am from the philippines myself)"
why the fk is it 12. I&#39;m from the Philippines and I didn&#39;t even know about this.
"Let them alone thean is taking care of them it dod not mattet the age defrent age  stop telling men they can not have a young lady u mist hate men u kust a b,,,,, leave us alone not up to u . U can not find a man  ? I lnow u problem"
Feminism doesn&#39;t thrives in Philippines.
Im Filipino but I didn&#39;t know age of consent is 12? WTF this is not even true at all. I now see how media is twisting facts and reports fake new. FAKE NEWS!!!

I&#39;m still proud for my mother because she was still able to study college even for a short time only.

"Parents are ignorant they don&#39;t know how to give advise to  their <a href=""http://children.so/"">children.so</a> their children got married early cause they don&#39;t really know the consequences after...sometimes lack of knowledge is so dangerous....that age they don&#39;t know the basic needs. First shelter..clothes...food...medicine and education....they should learn the contraceptive through seminar...."
thats why im not catholic ..
a lot of hypocrisy
Funny how she mentions this is a problem for the country and the government. Did they not consider that it&#39;s the governments fault for enforcing religion in the state? How about not having grooming laws? The very fact that divorce is illegal in the Philippines is messed up.
"This is such a sad documentary. These children have children with older men and learn about life early. The fathers leave them hanging high and dry after getting used and abused. Very sad situation. I hope that the age of consent really does change to avoid health issues for the young mother&#39;s and children. Such a lovely culture and people, but terrible epidemic."
"U ban abortions, and need permission for contraceptives but put the age of consent at 12?? How is that logical?"
then you dont know uch about church and your religion
That is misleading.The legal age at the Philippines is 18
"Very sad. The poverty cycle continues to turn. The culprits; poverty, ignorance, political greed and religious retardation."

That is wrong the legal age of consent is now 18
It is rare in the Philippines to have babies at 12 I have known just now that that happens. Parents in the Philippines are very strict they would not let their child have boyfriends/girlfriends until they reach 18. the parents of the 12 year old is maybe not worried on what could happen so they just let her do what she wants. And that part of the Philippines is one of the poorest place in there. Where parents would let their child work because it is hard to gain money there they will need to work as a family. In the rich city&#39;s parts I think they would just marry at 31 to 45 years of age well I know President Duterte would have handle that he is one of the best presidents in the world
what? this is the first time i heard that the age of consent is 12!! dafukk??

The early pregnancy is just happening in to those  young teenagers that could not afford to go to school because of poverty.  But for me even if you are  not educated person and too young you could imagine what if i get pregnant and will have a baby in a young age. What will happen to my life.. You have to think about future of yourself as well as your own baby.

"I believe we should not blame religion but rather educate ourselves. Education is really important and the government has to be serious about it. In our family, we are all Catholic. My parents are Catholic, my sister and me are Catholic. I grew up in a family where I know the term &quot;family planning&quot; and &quot;educational plan&quot; because we have it. We are not rich but we are also not financially deprived. I feel blessed that my parents are responsible even if only one of them is a college graduate. Now, the two of us (my sibling) are both in our 20s and still not married. We are both independent already and I hope this also happens to my future children. I believe that we should stop blaming religion or government. We&#39;ve had Roman Catholic as our religion for centuries now and the ugly truth is, it&#39;s part of our culture, part of us. We&#39;ve also been living in a democratic country for decades now, we&#39;re still considered as a &quot;young&quot; country. Maybe if we focus more on ourselves and decisions, we&#39;ll see that we live in a free country. All we have to do is to have &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;better choices&quot;. I know people who grew up in a very poor family but they chose education, now they are very successful. I also know people who grew up in a well-off family, now they are beggars because of poor choices. I am also not saying that those teenage girls are at fault. No they&#39;re not. They are victims of poor education, their parents as well, and the parents of their parents, so I hope they learn from their experience and end poverty as much as we can."

"18 is the legal age of consent....12 is the age when parents encourageme their kids to be more independent, since at this age they go off to highschool (there use to be no grade 7 or 8). Anyways, children&#39;s mentality in Phillipines is different from the West. In the west children at the age of 12 are still treated like a 10 year olds, however in Phillipines someone who is 12 years old is encouraged to act like a grown/mature lady, to show that their daughters are raised responsible and therefore suitable for &quot;courtship&quot;. Anyways it&#39;s always expected for girls around this age to start &quot;growing up&quot; cause if u don&#39;t you&#39;ll get looked at by people as childish of immature. When the truth is that 12 year olds ARE STILL CHILDREN - therefore they should be treated as children, and be given the right guidance to avoid misconceptions that: having a boyfriend will make them more mature, or that they know what&#39;s best for them, because they are still too young and innocent to decide"
"it is half witted guys getting half witted girls pregnant nothing is going to change there,blaming the church will do nothing individuals need to take responsibility"

these men just getting their rocks off need shot dead. While poor starving children born into this garbage mess.They need castrated and their junk cut off.

Only poor woman are hatching at high rate, they believe world is responsible to feed and take care of their children.  Animals have babies , but humans are in better position to make decision. People should learn from Chinese government about population control. I respected Chinese government for putting their foot down when it came population control.  Chinese women were not running around at the age of 13  to get knocked up. I admired Chinese government  that got involved in making decision for women and family. Nobody is starving in China. Most Chinese people are hard working people."
The Main Problem - Is the Catholic Church -- The Priests -- Resistance to the Birth Control-- And Also the Gov policy and laws--- Imaging 12 yrs girl -- Give consent And the no criminal charge against the man who got her pregnant !!!<br>She is still A Child -- what does she know about pregnancy and responsible Motherhood !!!
yo this is sick
Hey yow! catholic church has no fault causing of teenage pregnancy but their parents has the responsibility to discipline their childrens so Catholic church has no fault but their parents thus!
Please do have your facts straight. Thank you
HOW COME THE LEGAL CONSENT IS 12?  Do you have your facts straight????!! The legal consent in the Philippines is 21! Idiotic
"the religion does not take into count the poor young girls who are being raped they do not care about the horrible men commiting these crimes they only care about the unwanted lives these young girls are forced to give birth to after a terrible act of sin has been committed . religion is very sexist and unfair, it is absolute nonsense that narrow minded peodaphilic men try enforcing on their community , religion is a crime in itself ."
"i dont like how the white lady says its a problem for the government, how selfish can humans be. this is a serious issue and obviously they arent putting any money into helping with birth control or poverty and hunger for these people. how can she say it cost the government lots of money how ridiculous, these poor girls get raped and forced into having children and no one does anything for them"
"this women helping to abort babies is the murderer, she even dares asks for forgiveness before or after she helps abort the babies."
Its so unfair.   Its mean to the girls and their babies.   Both just don&#39;t have a fair chance to ever get out of poverty.

So SAD and totally unfair to those very young girl adults...God please help them...
The hypocrisy of religion.üò¢üò≠üò¢.
If the Catholic Church has so much influence then the age of consent should be much higher since the church does not believe in contraceptives and abortions.

So sad.
Why do poor people have so many babies???? So depressing  and irresponsible
"Such awful stories. The Catholic Church is so ignorant of the everyday person, especially the poor."
God that‚Äôs disgusting that u can buy an abortion potion and pills. &gt;_&gt;
Nothing wrong with getting pregnant at young age as long as you know how to take care of the baby.And stop blaming the religion  cuz it depends on us. There are lots of reason why lots of us  got pregnant at young age.
that church is the westboro baptist of philippines
I grew up a little in the country to know that a guy should either impregnate his girlfriend or is gay...
Abortion is not the answer but to teach family values so children are not subjected to predators.
I&#39;m a filipino and watching this makes me sad. I hope that one day our country will be literate and have enough means to get by everyday
The Catholic Church has a good intention but their intension results to bad economic situation. Since Catholic Church earns a lot of money from PRIVATE Schools that they OWN. Earns a lot of money from the CEMETERY that they OWN. Aside from the money that they earn from every masses they held and DONATIONS. Why cant they  BUILD massive orphanage for street children and for juvenile teenagers? Encouraging teenagers from ABSTINENCE through words is definitely not effective. They should protest TV Networks for filming teenage love stories. Surely these TV series which involves teenage love stories encourages teenagers to also indulge in teenage relationship and in turn results to teenage pregnancies. The CHURCH should also separate boys from girls in schools. And this should also be effective for public schools. They should also implement strict rules that when they cought teenagers involving in relationship they should render community service every summer such as sweeping in the streets since most Phil. Streets are dirty.
dumb filos. do they even study science at school level? catholic churches are misleading these young people.
Pansinin nyo lahat ng mahirap na bansa. . . KATOLIKO
"It&#39;s strange that they only talk about contraception and consent but there is no mention of school. All these kids need to be in school. Then they can learn all those things, be empowered and bigger dreams than being taken care of by a man becaue they got you pregnant! And this is probably an ignoarant opinion becausse there is not much mention of school in the video but i do believe school no matter how poor the standards are does help reduce the number of teenage pregnancies."

I feel creeped out. My prayers and love go to the young ladies and their children for what they&#39;re going through.
I wish we will improve in Philippines
"the condition like in cuba,oh my neighbour country yaaaaaa muslimah"
Theses laws make no sense. Age of consent is 12 however a man can go to jail if he gets a girl under 18 pregnant. Such bullshit! This has nothing to do with religion but straight up idiotic people in government.
"japan&#39;s age of consent is 13- though it&#39;s not as bad as the philippines....if that&#39;s the case, why don&#39;t they raise the age of consent to 18"
nasty people
Bobo pinoys
i flinched and flinched and flinched. this is really terrifying to be a girl in philippine. my brothers !! please know your role. dont let down yourself along with us. get some education. love the juniors and educate them.
The lies they make up about contraception is shocking.
"With truth and honesty, due to rampant poverty, these girls don&#39;t get educated and without a supportive environment they get into situations likes this. Yes, so they may be Catholic but without being educated, some cannot even understand the importance of gooding to mass or praying, etc. In short they need guidance"
"Pills and contraceptives are very much discriminated in the Philippines, parents doesn&#39;t encourage their children to buy them because it is the same as encouraging children doing &quot;stuff&quot; that are meant to be done when they&#39;re married, based on traditions. We can&#39;t blame most parents, but I think in order to deteriorate the number of teen pregnancy cases in the country, the government must provide counseling to teenagers, especially those who came from a broken family, or those who are influenced by their peers."
12 is the age of consent ?.....truly sick.
those girls... it&#39;s almost a curse to be born a female in that country
Nakakalungkot.. sa pakikialam ng simbahan .. DOH at Dept.Ed. inutil.. lalo naging mangmang at mahirap ating kababayan... hindi naaabot ang tamang kaalaman..

someone please rescue that child
overpopulation is the root of all problems we&#39;ve been encountering. The parents could have saved their children. They are the one to blame for what happened to their children.
Papogi pa ang bata hahahahahahahahah!!!
So nobody bothered to tell that child that one in three first pregnancies end in miscarriage and that it had nothing to do with jumping? How horrible. They are lied to so badly. Contraception doesn&#39;t damage your uterus. Having a child before your hips widen at 14-15 years old can though.
Too much freedom has given by parents instead of pushing them for education
"Ayan kasi.. Wala na ngang makain, anak pa ng anak.. Educate ourselves, people!"
What in the world is wrong with this government? Why are they letting the people live like this. The same fate lays in wait for their daughters. <br>It&#39;s all so needless.

"Having children young without being able to finish their education really does continue the cycle of poverty. My aunties were the same, then my cousins continued the cycle of having babies young and not finishing school. Thus they become stuck at home as a mother and the cycle continues. I really wish I can do something to help other young girls in my country..."
"Steve Chao is confused himself... he confuses the legal age of consent being 12 to be the allowed age for having babies. The legal age of marriage in the Philippines is 18. Civil courts and even the church wont allow marriage below 18 unless there is parental consent.  What Steve Chao is referring to concerns statutory rape. It is  a clause in the law giving way to the tradition of a specific tribe in Mindanao that practices fixed marriage and allows their children to marry below 18. The law also gives way to unwanted pregnancy but it does not condone it that is why parental consent before marriage is sought. Again, legal and marrying age in the Philippines is 18."
"Those peeps who questions the motives of this documentary and they were like &quot; its none of the westeners business&quot; or &quot; why those westeners dont fix their own problems in their own country ... blah blah blah..&quot;<br><br>Like c&#39;mon guys, issues like these should be addressed! These teenage moms SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS VICTIMS."
Them eyebrows thooo
I&#39;ve done part of my ojt in Fabella and I&#39;ve always felt sad seeing the young girls. They always tell me I&#39;m lucky to have been able to go to a university.
Philippines should be swallowed by the tsunami.
"Angela can get a child every two years then she has enough milk to feed the older teenage children when there is no feed.They can just suck, no utensils needed."
Babies are gifts from GOD.  And babies are beautiful.  I love them so much!  GOD BLESS all children :)  Amen.
this video USED STRONG WORDS that made me feel insulted.... even if I‚Äôm not pregnant IM JUST A CHILD 12 yrs old
Disgusting
Close minded filipino. üò¢
that medication is named arthotec. it is used to treat back pains and so other back issues. but many women use it for abortion.
One of the 12 tribes of Israel. I hope they WAKE UP to realize that.
Sadly most of these babies were probably conceived from rape.
"As long as we don&#39;t kill , children of God. These children got a purpose in Gods eye."
GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!!! GIRL IN THE LAST MINUTES OF THE VIDEO!!!!!!!!! IM CHEERING FOR YOU!!!!!!!!
sad.
This is the Philippines after edsa people power
hi pinoy ako
These ignorant societies need to be abolished.
The Philippines Is a crazy place
Sick nasty bastards. I just ask where is the fathers ? Cowards.
"oh, this is very upsetting!!!!! The fact that minor girls are being sexualy (ab)used by much older man was the first shity thing to see and upset me. When I saw the part where the religion runs the politics and condemns girls and women to save them selves, I got super f... maaaaaad!!!!!  Has nothing to do with any &#39;god&#39;ly matters but to enslave women and reducing them to baby bearing creatures or shaming them for getting pregnant. SICK SICK SICK &lt;- -&gt;RELIGIOUS PEOPLE!!!"
"These old behind boys preying on these kids! This is so disturbing, smh.... and these friggin BOYS know they can talk these unaware kids into it &amp; just walk away! Omg!! I want to help them.... And the mayor sounds like he condones it! Really?? Really??"
This is a true story cuz the current population of this is growing fast
"Population is growing because they follow religion banning condom contribution, contraception and abortion"
hawig ni maymay si kathryn bernardo
Onga. Ang ironic Lang. Makakabili ka NG mga pampalaglag sa paligid ng Quiapo Church. And almost everyone knows that. Ang mga taga simbahan na against these ay walang deadma Lang.
"The Catholic Church should feed and support them and stop teaching archaic ideologies, when in fact what it is doing is creating the poverty with its teachings. Disgusting and inhuman."
bec. the church doesnt want people to use condom and contraceptions the church is playing a major rule in this problem bec. more babies means more money. the president tried to tell the church but they got mad thats why they want him to get kicked out.
Very sad OMG
wait so meimei is 13 and the guy is 22 wtf?
Amma leave Philippines as soon as possible üòÇ
The whole thing all boils down to.......... MONEY
Well obviously none of these guy have met Chris Hansen
This makes me want to pass the RH BILL
"oh god, this is wrong on so many level..."
He should have been charged!
Babies having babies...its a sick world!
One of the reasons why people in poverty continue to have so much children is beacause they believe that more people= more people to help earn money. They also need proper education so they can make wiser decisions.
A white woman comes to the Philippines and start telling the local people what they should or should not do...
This is what happened after Aquino ruled
My gad! Landi nyo!! Kareng keng pa more imbis na mag aral!!
this is what we call FREEDOM
Church said new born is a gift
British have also lots of the same cases. Even a progressive country have the same problems what the third world have.
This is fact and surely this is the result sa pakikialam ng church sa mga batas na ginagawa sa bansa lalo na sa reproductive health law. Ang tagal na ng law na yan pero until now hindi pa nakakaurong.
hay naku pilipinas
Ano ang tingin nila sa mundong ito walang tao?  Kahit bata binubuntis.  Walanghiyang mga lalaki.   Puro bugok.
so how about the government raising the age of consent to 15 or 16 at least?  And how about providing food stamps  for children?  And Getting the men to pay child support?
what the government do? then what the rich people of philipines do to this society ? they spend a million of dollar to make beauty pageants then the poverty of the country what they do?
12 is the age of consent? I&#39;ve lived in the Philippines for almost fifteen years and this is the first time I heard of that.
Philippines people has beautiful eyes..
People why blame the chuch??? That&#39;s the parents responsibility.  And those people who touch the underage. It need to be punish &quot;hang&quot; them.
11 with a 22 year old ? Wtf does a 22 year old want with an 11 year old omg horrible so horrible
"Lol pinay girls are shown as victims here but in reality most of them are very smart . All they want is a man richer to them who can satisfy all their needs and all they wanna do is sleep .<br><br>Many Americans,Arabs,Punjabis, Africans have had a bad experience with filipinos"
This is why my mom birthed me in california and not in philipines.....
I&#39;m sure the researcher of this &quot;baby factory&quot; mean well...
It&#39;s totally unacceptable in India... Thank God that I am an Indian... But in Philippines it is surely the matter of concern... At the age of playing n studying the children are being parents... Really feel bad specially for women of this country... Gvt should take some concrete steps to get rid of such poor situation of the country
maybe they can try outercourse rather than intercourse
"Sad, sad, sad....That&#39;s because of illiteracy and lack of fear in God. I never knew that the age of consent is 12.  Rodel should be in jail for minor corruption and child abuse."
Killing kids is obviously not the answer. Punishing the grown men raping them is.
I just learned that the legal age of concent here was 12.
Just you guys know it&#39;s not only in Philippines
Abortion is murder?
The catholic against in any contraceptive in philippines because they believe that using birth control is illegal and kind of abortion. Many people in the philippines want to have a law about birth control
"I hate seeing the comments about the philippines being dumb etc. its not like they really know what philippines is. I dont understand why you guys also needed to call the philippines &quot;Baby Factory&quot;, im sure you have filipino viewers and dont you think they&#39;ll get hurt after seeing so many rude comments below... Im a filipino and im sure filipino&#39;s will treat you as a family because when you dont know someone here in the philippines we call them &quot;Kuya&quot; to ask or whateves and kuya means brother"
The sway of the church in the culture is ingrained for CENTURIES - hard to move on from that mind set. It will take a huge political will and people who will wake up to the need of population control.
by the way not only in the phillipines that teenagers get pregnant.Even in the west.
A problem which is too difficult to uproot
this is so messed up in so many levels...
The age of consent in the Philippines is 18 yrs old! Those who got pregnant at early age I think happen in any country. Poverty one the is the main problem .
"&quot;Age of consent&quot; @12 years old in the Philippines, is for the immunity of Catholic priests, being sent to court or prison.<br> The church is continuing this policy action in order to prevent this anticipated event, child molestation,  from happening.<br><br>Religion is the root cause poverty in Philippines."
The Church has a lot to answer for. This is a massively important issue.
pagtuunan ng atensyon ang UBAS. Ugnayang Bayan At Simbahan. Thanks !
"I&#39;m filipino, turning 24, and is a nursing student. This is all true. We once delivered a baby to a 12 year old whose boyfriend was like 30 years old."
All Asian and African countries need to stop with this overpopulation.  Hopefully UN push soon to stop this overpopulation.
These people need to be taught about sexual education and access to contraception ASAP ! Abstinence until marriage is not realistic! Especially in this country when these young girls are being taken advantage of by much older men.
Preaching abstinence is clearly not working...
The place looks like a dump it looks unhealthy it looks filthy and might even have be full of disease trash everywhere and little girls children living like that are horrible
idiot country
12?? Age of consent?? Hahahaha hindi ba 18? In my years here in the Philippines. I&#39;ve always know it was 18 year old üòÇ
"ITS NOT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WHOS TO BLAME,IT IS THEIR PARENTS"
"This breaks my heart. These girl&#39;s are NOT at all teens! They are still kids. It seems like no one cares, no help, no guidance, no laws. I hope a light shines down on them all very soon. :("
this is one of the issues duterte wins a landslide. many philippine president hold in office but failed to implement family planning  because they scared the catholic  preist  and lead to  lost their political carrier. catholic preist in the philpiines are very powerful in political arena. but duterte has a ball. he is the only president of the philippines implemented the family planning.  if this young mothers were educated about family planning during their teens. probably this problem will be prevented.
Stupid teenagers I think young woman are getting more and stupid as the generation goes on
No matter you breachand  but you believe in  God the bless  to you and your baby  bless I know  I will  pray  for over the  world  I think  that me or my kids  or my grandkids  God bless all the kids  and all the Mothers  I love  every one of you like the mom like  me
18 years is the age of consent or emancipation in the Philippines not age 12..
"Obviously, ignoring the problem, and abstinance, is not working. The PI population is now 100 million and there is not the jobs or the economy to support that many. These young girls are open for exploitation and their well-being is being ignored."
It is not possible to miscarry at 7 months. Any loss of pregnancy after the first trimester is called a stillbirth.
This people needs to learn. they are not using their. brain. the parents are stupid too. mga. pilipinong hindi nag iisip.
"we need to sterilize more people or at least not be questioned why people go childfree. it‚Äôs because of this, i do not want children."
"Pregnant at 11yrs old to a man 8yrs older, sick"
Age 12 that‚Äôs so young... I get their Catholic/religious and your supposed to be fruitful but also married. Back then BCE yes they had children young like 14 and15 but they also were married. Also in America it‚Äôs different.
The white lady thats speaking freaks me out with those eye brows
"Hypocrisy at its finest from the Catholic Church!!! I don&#39;t like Duterte&#39;s foul mouth and South China Sea strategy but his socialist agenda like family planning, I&#39;m all in for it!!! Living in Manila for 30 years now, children are everywhere with no parents to guide them and most of them are even out of school. They are like stray dogs and cats begging for food and some even doing crime stuffs to meet their needs. It&#39;s a f*****g cycle as they will multiply like their parents before them and it goes on and on while the Catholic hiearchy through its vast network of schools, hospitals and propaganda machine still teaches with absolute certainty that everyone can do abstinence. I hope the liberal west (I&#39;m a liberal myself) will also focus on addressing these type of issues and raise alarm bells and not just on Duterte&#39;s rhetoric."
Maimai is so gorgeous! Why don&#39;t I see people like her in Filipino movies?
Pretty sure the age of consent in Philippines isn&#39;t 12. Please get your facts straight.
Wow..isn&#39;t that awful how they can speak English as a second language but look how ethnic their beliefs are and most of their people are boastful and airheads
"This is really sick ,a woman should be able to decide when to have a baby and that guy that is against contraception is really sick. If you can&#39;t take care of yourself don&#39;t bring a baby into this world. It will make his/her  life miserable."
Just sick
"They are poor, no opportunity, no education.  Help those young girls, they will become mothers someday. The cycle should be stop. Organizations for poor young girls should be initiated. Those poor family with young girls should call to attention.  Save those young girls."
&quot;The ancient saying;<br>&#39;who can understand the ways of a male with a virgin&#39; ?<br>is a very prolific saying.&quot;<br>circa: King Solomon
"&quot;Interesting video, <br>yet Providence in essence views the legal age of consent to be the flower<br>age that of 16, for specific reasoning that are precaution and preservation<br>oriented, and for ensuring vast things, and it depends on internal maturity,<br>spirited, often, but the video does reveal the whys in ways, though Providence<br>isn&#39;t an too technical with things Entity, it is sound to encourage it gradual,<br>yet there are more to the phili...., that of an national focal of things, worthy <br>of furtherance of enhancement of discussions, may the enhancing and or<br>uplifting of the prosperity levels be one of the main topics, and nourished spirituality,<br>but in the scenarios of the likes of circumstances upon which males embrace a female<br>for union oriented things, it is very commendable when the males remain in the lives of those females,<br>as opposed to abandonment&quot;."
"Where did your researchers get the idea that the legal age of consent is 12? According to our laws and jurisprudence a minor, 12 years or older, CANNOT give a valid consent to a coitus."
Backwards value and mentality. Just abort plain and simple.
Sad about this news
12 years is not the age of consent! I am a filipino and never heard that law in my country. Its them as individuals consent themselves to do it
education must be
"UNfortunately evangelical pressure here in the US is driving young desperate women and girls to these very same methods. For example In Texas large segments of the poor are being forced to either give birth or travel to Mexico to obtain the ulcer medicine mentioned and the same useless religious based &quot;abstinence til marriage&quot; bs , that study after study has demonstrated is ineffective, is being taught in PUBLIC schools and is already driving up teen pregnancy rates. If this looks bad to you please vote to protect the right of women to control their own bodies."
"wwhaaattt??? where are the fruits an veggies at when they talk about not having no food?? i dont comprehend, this is where i buy my coconut oil from?? they have sooo many differnt tress to eat from from such beautiful land?? what happened? why poverty? why so much trash??? why so sick???"
"Oh wow they&#39;re singing &quot;The Man Who Can&#39;t be Moved&quot; by The Script, nice!"
Lol Manila is disgrace
Is it just me or most of them look Hispanic
"Honestly, I don&#39;t think God would like how people are intruding/ruining others&#39; lives with their opinions and ideas. If they&#39;re living their lives the &quot;wrong&quot; way, let them be judged by God at the appropriate time. Live your own life, make sure you don&#39;t do what they&#39;re doing (don&#39;t be a hypocrite) and leave them to their own lives. What&#39;s so hard about that?"
This should be shown in schools instead of a video of giving birth (that was what was shown to us back in high school). This would have been more effective to scare teenagers
my GOD! you will not kill any baby when using contraceptives :P<br>Will this against contraceptives help feed the families who follow their &quot;go spread and multiply&quot;.
"Looks like filipinos are mounting a challenge to the chineses and indians to be over populated. At the rate the filipinos are reproducing, they will take the over populated title by the next century."
"Aljazeera, please get your facts straight. The age of consent in the Philippines is not 12. A person is allowed to drive, vote, and drink at age 18. However, it is true that many teenage pregnancies do happen, predominantly in those living in poverty; but this does not immediately imply that the age of consent falls below 18 years. It is disturbing that your news agency would publish stories without even ensuring factual information."
"I believe anywhere you go, the age of consent is 18 when you can legally decide for yourself. In regard to problems of bearing a child, education should be strengthen. For the babies that are abandoned by their parents, they should have a loving home. The Philippine government needs to review their adoption process whether local or international. There are families that are so willing or even begging to adopt those babies. Let those babies have a good life."
That&#39;s right girls
"They&#39;re wrong,  the legal age of consent is 16 or 18. Lol 12 makes no sense at all"
SEPARATE RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT
girl is beAUTIFUL BUT THE  man is ugly
We need to separate religion and government smh this is one of the leading causes of the poverty
How is it possible that the age of consent is twelve?? They are still children! And they don&#39;t even know anything about contraception... not only that but also it&#39;s a way to keep poverty around
Its not 12 its 18
Men should really be respectful and learn I feel so bad for the younger girls in the Philippines üáµüá≠
Ignorance ignorance..
"The Lord told us to multiply on Earth and increase upon it, we will be populating Mars soon."
This isnt only about religion. Lack of education too. A lot of factors to consider.
"The church should have far less agency they have on the public and the government, because they&#39;re just brainwashing young naive people that any form of birth control besides abstinece is morally wrong"
"you want  stupidity and hypocracy , come to my country the beautiful philiphines"
hypocrit politician makes my tummy churns
blame god and the stupid church.
the legal age of consent is not 12. where did his come from? our official legal age of consent is 18 according to the law!
Really tragic lack of education it&#39;s the first thing I taught my daughter. Well almost first thing
I am so glad I move from a 3rd world country to the states. Ppl do look at you a way when you go to by a condom and it‚Äôs very taboo to see plan b. I am so grateful I can go to college and get pregnant when I want and not by force or mishaps
NAIVE people. That&#39;s why Philippines is poor.
Why are all the females blaming themselves for getting pregnant? Do any of these woman know males get females pregnant? It&#39;s the dudes fault. And most of these nonsexual girls at age of 14 were forced/raped and then got pregnant. WTF!!!!
Church needs to be separate from politics. They have a corrupt country
The Catholic Church ruins another nation!
Ang chinese garter ......
"It is evident here in the comments that most of you are blaming the catholic church for holding back such laws such as the rh bill. Remember that Philippines is a conservative country and it is not only the catholic church are opposing to it. There are a lot of different religious dominations are opposing. But the catholic church has the limelight so the blame are being thrown at them. <br><br>There are still a lot of ways to stop teen age pregnancy by advocating it to the people especially in provinces or slums which really lacks attention from the government. Rh bill is not the only way to solve this problem. It doesn&#39;t mean that this bill is still being debated, the finding of solutions will be stagnant as well. People should be open minded specially with this matter so that they can freely communicate with the youth. The youth should be aware of the consequences of teenage pregnancy through the guidance of their parents or elderlies. Learning starts from home. Don&#39;t completely rely on institutions and wait for them to educate your children. And government can also conduct programs about the advocacy of teenage pregnancy to educate the people. Based in this video, the women are not aware of the outcomes of their actions. They lack awareness, guidance and they do not know their rights. Thats why they are easily drawn with this situation. And because of poverty, the &quot;victims&quot; choose to stay rather than fight their rights and make a better decision."
This documentary is very sad and disturbing.
"While all other countries get old to bankrupt governments and disappear, Philippine, India and China will grow to be strong."
Abortion is Murder. better use contrasiptive
kawawa naman ang turo bastus.punta kau sa Bible Baptist church para alam nyo ang Bible.
"As early as 1995, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child advised the Philippines to pass a law clearly establishing the age of consent. It has refused to do so. The question is why?<br><br>The Anti-Rape Law of 1997 otherwise known as R.A. 8353 describes rape as a sexual act with anyone below 12 year of age.<br><br>It should be raised this it is practically child trafficking. Make the age 18"
God said go to the world and multiply.but also sin if you multiply and you can afford to give food 3x a day.

"Thank you for this video, it was insightful. I&#39;m sad to admit that I had no idea that teenage pregnancy was this bad in my country. And omg, the age of consent is 12 (!!!) but we are only allowed to buy contraceptives when you reach 18? How does that make any sense!?"
Precious baby and children ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
So sad
"At that age, I&#39;m scared someone courting me. I&#39;m not comfortable. I&#39;m too shy to talk. I&#39;d  run away most of the time even though i had a crush to one of my admirers."
Wow so heartbreaking
"This is sickening to watch, so much ignorance + lack of education, logic, &amp; common sense. Just horrible for these little girls"
I am extremely sad for my country after watching this.
prevention is better than cure
Legal age 18 not 12 your news is wrong and around the world it happend not only in the philippines CRAZY....
Sad that babies are having babies I would adopt them and give them a good loving home
Had two terminations
If I lived in philliphines wud have had two children put up for adoption thank god I live in uk
So basically this video is about grown men raping little girls and getting them pregnant. This results in unnecessary national dept and global population growth. The solution seems pretty obvious: change the age of consent to 15 or more and protecting young girls from rape.
"Ganyan ang pinoy...kuntinto lng kong ano ang meron...lalo na kong lumaki ka sa lugar na mahirap, lahat ng nkapaligid sayu walang kapangapangarap sa buhay...ayaw nila umasinso,di iniisip ang kinabukasan,kya mas lalong humihirap dahil ayaw nila subukang iangat ang sarili nila..Pero kong itry mong lumabas sa lugar nyu don mo makikita ang ibang mundo na wala sa lugar na kinalakihan mo."
I&#39;m just so sad and angry at the same time
Minsan hnd n dn ntn malaman kng cnu sisihin sa mga ganitong sitwasyon..kc minsan merun dn kbataan n sadyang subrng..d ndin makontrol ng mgulang dala ng barkada..kht gaanu pa kaayus ang mgulang sa pg aalaga ng knilang mga anak

"ANak ng anak at ipa sa Dyos na lang.. Nge.. Binigyan ka ng Dyos ng sentido kumon na utak. Yung mga bata naging tambay, palaboy tapos isisi sa gobyerno.. Mga ugok.."
Heart crushing.  A vicious cycle.
I really wish the Philippines could separate the state and church...
There are people who are very weak and you can see it from watching this. Faith Has so many Highs and Lows and this is one low.
"Lack of education and parental guidance, not religion. I grew up in the slums until I was 21. My parents were poor. We are Catholics. They made sure we don&#39;t suffer the same fate and we didn&#39;t! They work hard just so we can have a degree and have decent jobs."
Rich people are busy making money while the poor are busy making babies smh.
My heart breaks for the ignorance that surrounds them.  This only becomes a cycle of suffering and poverty.
I want to adopt one I&#39;m serious i want a baby
Heartbreaking!
"A nation doved the baby factory? Who doved it? Al Jazerra? The fertility rate for the Philippines is only 3. That means every woman (or a husband and wife couple) is only averaging 3 children. Two is considered holding the population at the same population. As usual, news media shows pictures of crowded hospitals for the lower income and spew their lies while being paid by Western Satanist Eugenicists. Their anti-gospel preaching is funded well so that these billionaires and trillionaires can have this world to themselves and a select few million slaves. What they don&#39;t know is, Satan&#39;s plan is to eliminate all humans in his war against God. In the end they will be tempted to war against each other until he slaughters the last survivor."
"What the heck, why is everyone blaming the religion and politics? Most of the men getting these girls pregnant are much older, old enough to know better than them and to make better decisions. The only ones responsible for this is them, not religion nor politics."
"I read useless comments because of different mentalities. For us it&#39;s normal to have the first kid by 25 years old, it&#39;s normal to take care of the babies, it&#39;s normal to create a family with financial stability, without poverty because we have these opportunities. They don&#39;t. In other parts of the world, it&#39;s normal to have kids at 11. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s right (because it&#39;s obvious that it isn&#39;t), but it&#39;s normal for them. I&#39;m filipina, I grew up in Philippines then in a European county, so I know what I&#39;m talking about. I know that it&#39;s not fair what it&#39;s happening in Philippines, but it&#39;s not helpful to think &quot;omg, do they know it&#39;s wrong? That shouldn&#39;t be happening&quot; because guess what? It&#39;s happening anyway. (For example, Trump shouldn&#39;t be president, global warming or slavery shouldn&#39;t be still a problem in 2018...). What we should do is read more about this kind of information, talk more about these issues if we can&#39;t do anything in the concrete, instead of sayin &quot;geez, that shouldn&#39;t be happening.&quot; because that is not helping, not even our culture."
"Leon Nguyen, I&#39;m with you on this!"
"I&#39;m a naturalized American now but I went back to the Phil. and really disliked the influence the church has on the country. I truly believe it&#39;s one of the biggest things holding the country back. That and nepotism which also run amok there. Otherwise the country is a great place. Fun, sunny, full of good people, and full of natural resources. But again I hate how the Catholic Church is keeping the country backwards with there draconian dogma."
I hate how powerful the Catholic Church is the Philippines.
"it&#39;s just a breeding ground at this point, if these people can&#39;t handle their sexual urges i recommend masturbation lol"
"i honestly hate how these men just play with these young girls feelings and just getting them pregnant, I wonder if these girls know that most of these men already have families prior to knowing them"
That is terrible and very wrong
everyones a ped0 and no one cares smh
So u make the consent age 12 but the age to get contraceptives 18?
There need to be more severe consequences to these men!  It seems like more older men taking advantage of young girls.  Also empowering parents to educate their children if the schools and government won&#39;t.
You know why this is happening? Its because ppl or teenagers now a days doesnt know the word &quot;abstinent&quot; this should&#39;t happen in the first place if they know how to control themselves and wait until they are fully capable of setteling down.
Because of poverty and lack of education.
When are we Filipinos going to realize that the Catholic church is the true enemy and that our blind adherence to it is preventing us from progressing beyond this cesspit?
Filipinos in poverty or in a low income class don‚Äôt think logically cause logic is taught in school. Most of those teenaged parents can not afford school. So instead they think with their emotions and according to what they feel is right.
"A lot of this story is based on lies.... the guy with the wife and kids probably knew she was 14 but didn&#39;t care. The girl knew he was older too but was either looking for love or money which he was providing to her. There is free contraception to people, but most are too lazy or afraid to go get it. You don&#39;t necessarily need permission to do so. <br><br>It is true that the majority of the nation is Catholic, but there are also Protestants, Buddahists, etc. and there is nothing wrong with the &quot; religion&quot; situation.... They specifically used those people in the video to attack religion and everyone who is Filipino ( which I am) can see it that this video is used for propaganda."
I can‚Äôt finish watching this. The first story gutted me. No child should have to endure this. I hope she can make a better life for herself away from the lecherous predators in her life.
Child molesters and pathetic parents
"this should be sent to those priests... the senate have been trying to pass the law to control this, but the catholic church dont want any of those. sheeesh!"
Thats the result of being a catholic country....Now president du30 want action....new constitution...

Uneducated people only is the one breeding like a rabbit
I live in Manila
This country is screwed.  This stuff usually has a way of working itself out eventually.
"THIS IS GREAT! He is saying you get pregnant and don&#39;t want the baby, have it and bring it to ME. He will take care of the baby, or people in his church. They will find a home for the unwanted babies."
This tugs at my heart. So many issues here.  I used to live  in the Philippines  - it&#39;s my second home.  I&#39;ve adopted 2 kids from the Philippines and they both came from this sort of scenario.  I&#39;ve also been an adoption social worker and facilitated adoptions   from the Philippines to US families. It&#39;s a wonderful place to adopt from and I encourage anyone who feels called to adopt to consider the Philippines. Blessings to that beautiful country.
How frustrating
All these poor people having kids just creates more poverty and violence. Philippines will never advance if this continues but that what the Catholic church wants. They make more money and have more kids to molest.
This is eye opening. Legalized child molestation.  I&#39;m shocked...
I wonder when will Filipino men realize the days of aspiring to have 12 children are long gone. It&#39;s not 1920 anymore.
Religion sees contraceptives as &quot; demonic &quot; <br>I think religion is evil because it enslaves the population to superstitious beliefs that make people irrational.
"My country&#39;s government is the Church. When they were against birth-control everyone followed like complete sheeps. There is an overpopulation crisis in the country, yet nobody&#39;s alarmed. There&#39;s not enough schools, houses, and resources to support a new batch of children everyday."
The translation is not very good.
It is the fact that most of teenagers always reminded by parents that finish school and study hard yet most of them disobeying the orders. Hard headed of course üòë
"Twisted mentality, twisted religion."
People are so focused on criticizing the WAR ON DRUGS when there are bigger problems in the Philippines everyday. Thank you for this video but this situation will never change. The Catholic church would freak out if we even talk about CONDOMS. The president is the president but the Catholic church is the REAL BOSS in the Philippines.
Legal consent here in ph is not 12...it&#39;s 18...
"It&#39;s very easy to blame a child&#39;s immaturity but when you think about it, they really are IMMATURE BECAUSE THEY ARE CHILDREN. Add POVERTY into the mix and what more can you expect? these children who just got pregnant are also raised by children so it&#39;s a never ending cycle. The EDUCATION SYSTEM needs to change but I don&#39;t think it will."
decades of research prove that abstinence only education does not work. The church needs to get out of public health and leave it to doctors. this is horribly sad
üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ I didn&#39;t know that this country was suffering like this until I started looking on internet it just breaks my heart to see poverty and children forced into sexual activity so young and death of children young cancer missing children it&#39;s all over the world sad..I&#39;m glad they should have to be married to have a baby it would help make family members be more cautious and responsible..heartbreaking
I&#39;m glad my grandparents mov d out of the Philippines.
WHY is 12 the age of consent?!  How does that align with religious ideals?  Do little girls not matter to the Catholic Church/Philippines government?  This is truly sick.
"the Phil. government . and church leaders should  absolutely to be blame,,because they think so many people will become slaves to their CORRUPTION agenda  specially exporting construction and domestic help to MIDDLE EAST and other countries,,the church/religion AND GOVERNMENT  make good business (you know what I mean) IN THIS,,,,,HOY, D.O.H mandatory implement LIGATION/VISECTOMY  to parents who has 2 childrens,,specially in POOR/SQUATTERS area,,,,because PHILIPPINES  is SINKING,,it is only a small  country WITH LIMITED RESOURCES ,,,,hoy  gising,,,SHAME ON YOU!!!"
This is so sad
"Aren&#39;t you afraid of God, ABORTIONIST?"
"May God have MERCY on your SOUL... your prayers are USELESS because you are MURDERING an unborn baby.  You are an associate, assistant in killing several children. So in order to eat you have to kill and murder several babies WHAT? Then you pray WHAT? May God have MERCY on your SOUL...ABORTIONIST."
The vast majority of Filipinos are very immature and prefer to believe that nothing is their fault and that the real problem is the drug dealers and pot smokers and killing these people is the best solution lol.
He sent his parents money for years
"Are the women there in the Philippines who don&#39;t have children rich or well off? I think this video is just victim blaming... It&#39;s a biological function. If they are able to conceive, it&#39;s their time. Once that window closes in a woman&#39;s life she cannot have kids. Is the goal to eliminate the people or the REAL CAUSES of their poverty? The same European women are getting IVF, using other minority- raced impoverished women as surrogates (womb rental), adopting abroad, etc to have children. Maybe jealously because these women don&#39;t have any problem. They can still complete school with kids if that is the goal. Eliminating it reducing the number of brown people doesn&#39;t address the social and political issues of these former colonies or the special needs of colonized people. They aren&#39;t children and don&#39;t need paternalism, they need self governance."
Philippines glad my dad came to America. I have aunts who still live in village in mountains
"It is very natural and trigger happy for Al Jazeera to broadcast the negative corner of the Philippines to the hypercritical and censorious eyes of the world. Philippines is not the only poor country in the world, there are even worse than Philippines out there but Al Jazeera is hesitant to put those country&#39;s name in Bold title. People around the world are watching this docu fiesting the semblance strong indignation a pittiful ways of life of the entire country, but repudate the encouraging good side around. I have knowledge that several filipinos are working in Al Jazeera tv network, some of them are journalist reporter on screen. I wonder if they still consider themselves as filipinos who did nothing but to tolerate this disheartened kind of malicious staging about the filipinos in general."
Women are strong but if we don&#39;t have good man to help protect our rights women wouldn&#39;t have sit on table. Our liberties would be gone.
Of course he knew she was 14.
"I feel so sorry to this teenagers. Im 26 and im still afraid of having a baby because its hard to raise a child in the PH.  <br>The sad part is religion and logic clashes in this country.   <br>For me, contraception is the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Especially to the poor."
1 less mouth to feed!!! Filipinos dont use that term on people we use it for animals when there are too many to feed
I think that is only or mostly possible in the or near the capital. I live in the province and really far from the capital so we dont have much of those &quot;slums&quot; with a large number of teenage pregnancy. parents here are a lot more strict than there. like to the point that my dad would make me bring a stun gun every time i would go out.
NWO  rules (!)
"Kakalungkot nmn, sa lugar q Khit papaano wala png 15 na nbuntis, the youngest is 18 yrs old.. mhirap lng nmn sa lugar pero mostly ung mga Bata ngaaral. Kunti lng ung wlng mga interes . 11 nabuntis wla png mga isip un."
My heart breaks watching this video. I hope we could do better.. üíî
Danmm they be going with young girl this problem need to stop
It the Catholic believe fault the should have birth control of something
"Unfortunately this is very common in areas of poverty, they ware unaware of contraceptive, can not get it or have false ideas of what it might do to them."
"This is what happens when religion and state are together, plus politicians lining their own pockets and putting their families in positions of power."
I hope al jazeera 101 east would also make a documentary about the goodness and positive happenings about the Philippines. I observed that every documentary they made about the Philippines are negative and pittiful. The worse is it has a big impact to the global stage depicting the overall image of the country. Please and I hope this television network has no malicious intent to downgrade the dignity of the filipino people. Poverty and crime is undeniably rampant in the Philippines but it doesn&#39;t represent the whole country. Aljazeera if you are balance media institution you should also make a documentary about the positive side of the Philippines. Perhaps you forgot the significant contribution of filipinos in building your country as you progress.
Nakakahiya pootek .....ang low lives at mga walang breeding!
"Thats a very sad reality but we filipinos must face this problem, education had a great help if  those young women are going in school and continue thier studies, i noticed filipina women are beautiful uniqueüòç"
Roman catholic is destroying the world. the antichrist since the beginning who also killed christ but using the name and the word of God to lore and deceive mankind
Having a children is not an easy task..its about a responsibility
Is it just me or Mae Mae (?) looks like Kathryn Bernardo?
I was raised catholic I went to catholic school and I believed everything I was taught. It wasn&#39;t until I had my own kids and opened my eyes to see what was really going on. The catholic church is so corrupt and they want people to have as many kids as possible so they have more power. The things that go on in the catholic church makes me sick.
There should be no baby Factory if you have a baby you have to take care of it you don&#39;t give it to a factory that&#39;s not how the world should work
üò£üò£üò£
If they don&#39;t have enough money why still giving birth to a child ??? They did not imagine what they could give and support their children as long as they are happy what they did??? Where is the logic? You are just adding another problems in this country
These creeps getting underage girls pregnant are so disgusting!
Baby factory? Totally disrespectful and inappropriate. Not fake news but TRASH non-news!
Yeah! They remind me of black women! Having babies at 11 and 12 years old by 10 different men.....
Well.......the Egyptians had kids at 11 and 13 years old! So i guess this isn&#39;t that bad!
What about AIDS and HIV????
you must be 18 and older for being new mom and dad that ages is safe from child abuse
This is RAPE
oh my god i see mostly young girl having baby.
A lot of these men look really nasty and disturbing smh
Education and with out the Catholic Church involve is the solution to lessen the teenage pregnancy or having plenty of babies in one family !
"<b>11 and pregnant,</b> <b>while me, 20, laying on the couch eating chips, never dated anyone</b>"
It is easier to use contraceptives than abort a baby. Prevention over murder!
"On the other hand, I live in the Philippines. I have a wonderful career, a loving husband and all the necessities in life to have a family but I can&#39;t get pregnant."
Men are bad news in this context taking advantage of lack of education!
My heart is broken while watching this video. I feel sad for the girls...
I am married 17 years old because my parent ask me Marry him actully I don&#39;t love him  and my ex husband 30 years old ! We together 13 years and I have a babies twin baby but finally we divorce because  he treat me no good ! He cheat on me and my twin baby all with me now my twin baby growing up already 17 years old tks god I&#39;m lucky woman because I have twin baby all with me ( I&#39;m Asian woman Indonesian bandung  confident / INDEPENDENT forever )
"Yung babaeng nasa dokyu na nagsabing &quot;I will not use contraceptives, blah blah, because I&#39;m a Catholic&quot;, ewan. Kakainin nya ang mga sinabi nya. Pero di ko rin masisi yung kawawang bata, dahil hinaharang kasi ng Simbahan ang RH Law. Katoliko ako, at nakakahiya / nakakadismaya ang ganitong kalakaran."
"Why does Al Jazeera always cover and film only the negative topics of Philippines? They never once cover the beautiful side of Philippines, but always focusing on the bad. It seems like  a PROPAGANDA MOVE to me, With the intention to paint a bad image for the world to see. What a one sided news outlet."
Go back to Britain leave the Filipino people to sort it out themselves you have no right there
Contraception is a sin before God. Stop fornicating.
May may it wasn&#39;t us than the baby was lost it was a sin you committed fornication
"I am happy Philippines has many babies to love. Europe, Korea and Japan are below population replacement because they are not having babies."
this disgusts me. i feel so sorry for those girls.
This is Philippines not your problem go to other country or do your business at your home.
The Philippines have many children and many young people in Thailand right now we have problem with aging population  like in the west many Thai woman do not want to have children  most Thai only had one or two kid because children now are very expensive.Bangkok are have the most single woman in Southeast Asia age between 30-40 still single no children. I hope in the further The Philippines population birth rate are slow down.The Philippines children are so cute look very much like Thai.
Phillipine is not a poor country ...this country are even rich than Saudi Arabia or USA ...this land can sustain a billion life it can grow food and fish .... Because of economic ruled by money make them poor...

My mother moved to America from the Philippines..
"The sin is an adult man sexually abusing a child, but she blames herself for loosing a baby! I want to go slap the abuser silly. Absolutely disgusting. Hair the mum felt awkward talking about contraception.., so do teachers, we just have to get on with it. Age of consent is twelve, that&#39;s appalling. If you&#39;re old enough to be a partners parent you&#39;re no better than paedophile scum. The country is letter ing kids down"
"I&#39;m really surprised that the legal consent is so low in the Philippines and in Japan, it&#39;s 13 (the lowest of developed countries)."
wow..
this is what happens when you have a middle eastern news channel reporting about asia.why don&#39;t they ever talk about whats  wrong with sharia law and how they force their women to wear ninja suits.They wont do it because its a arab channel.
I love the Philippines and my family is obviously there but every time I went there for my holidays. Family members would always say ‚Äúwag ka muna mag asawa‚Äù (don‚Äôt get married yet) or they‚Äôd say ‚Äúwag ka muna mag anak‚Äù (don‚Äôt have a baby yet). It‚Äôs like their views on people from abroad are that they‚Äôre so liberal and you know.... don‚Äôt care about waiting till marriage. But then I see my cousins and nieces have babies at the age of 14. Philippines sees itself so conservative. Yet it‚Äôs not really.
"It&#39;s frustrating/scary being a female in this country because you  have meager control over your own reproductive rights. You can&#39;t legally get rid of a rape/incest fetus. And after all of that, you&#39;d still deal with the stigma and the laws that favours the perversions of the rapist. And even if you decide to carry the child to full term so that you could give it up for legal adoption, nobody wants it. Many people in social media who say that &quot;why abort when you can give it away?&quot; are plain clueless as to the small amount of babies here in the PH who have legally undergone through the adoption process. Most adoptions here are either familial adoptions or illegal ones which are done without papers. There are charity youth homes here overrun with rape mothers who have no other choice but to get stuck with the reminder of their trauma. <br><br>People here always say &quot;Don&#39;t get rid of it, other people can&#39;t even have children&quot; or even &quot;Poor child. I&#39;d like to adopt him/her&quot;... however, those are just empty words. When faced with the reality of the adoption process, they wouldn&#39;t even bother. And if they really want to adopt, most of them would simply rather choose to adopt a distant relative or some other child who is not a product of violence (though they wouldn&#39;t admit it loudly)."
"these irresponsible parents, naku..they should educate their children and watch over them..too many kids teen aged pregnancy is really a big problem there, and the government should do more and stop being corrupt!"
I wonder why they played a Javanese gamelan music in the background?
lol why using traditional music from jawa
"Fucken oats,."
How many girls are being raped here and made to stay with rapist but contraceptives should be pushed to girls!?! Realism of the world and my heart breaks. How do we rally from the states?
"Wow, that Lady has killed over 1,000 Babies! She prays each time for her sins to be forgiven! It&#39;s not meant to work that way. She says she does it for money. A life is taken for $80! Another life is taken when the Mother dies from hemorrhage. The poison they can take early on in a pregnancy can&#39;t be good for the Mother either. Believing the Lord, Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins was not meant to keep committing murder and ask for forgiveness each time! You should want to do the right thing for yourself, others and God. No one is perfect and I let God judge. I don&#39;t know how she sleeps at night."
Education the key to solve this ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù as the gynecologist said.
Why somebody keep uploading this. This is a long time ago documentary
At least someone is doing something. Thank god.
Urgent is an understatement. The government neeeds to step up.
"Catholic church, or any Religion, who form a community country, should fix it&#39;s community country problems. If not, Fack off! Period. It&#39;s that simple. A Religion who cannot fix the community problem, should die off and be replace a new one. What was the point of your religion, to ask donation and more donations. After that, preach the end of the world. What a Joke. If that is your belief, then from the start everyone is fack up."
I could research this but what I&#39;m curious about is this something new or a slide backwards?  I thought  the Philippines was a little better educated and more progressive.
catholic church is hipocrite!!!
"The richest 1% in the world own more than the other 99%. That is the root cause of poverty, hunger, ignorance and lack of education, which causes so many social problems like this."
"With the govt failure to spend on teenage pregnancy prevention and education, the govt has created a huge problem for itself, the country and the population. What a mess. These young girls don&#39;t know anything and need to be protected from exploitation."
Humanity is f&#39;ed up
Religion Especially the majority but not all of the catholic church is a backward and useless for a nation that wants to develop and be progressive . We Filipinos must decide what our futures will be now that we have decent goverments aquino and duterte they hate each other but atleast they are progressive. We need to decide if we want the world to see us this way as in this documentary or strive for something better like the malaysians
"I just want to point out this view of the slums does not represent the whole of the philippines, so I hope this video does not produce a negative outlook on this country"
Why is that the title has the Philippines flag??
"It is not just the church, it is also some people in the government who opposed the health bill saying that it is none of the lawmakers&#39; concern. Sheesh! They failed to see that the people cannot discipline themselves therefore it is time for a policy to be imposed. Philippines cannot support its people now and even worse if this continues which could even lead to bigger problems in the future. I am more upset to the parents. Parents should know better as well. These girls are underage and they are still primarily their parents&#39; obligation. How could they just turn a blind eye. Seriously!"
"NGO? I know who you are, a puppet and a destroyer."
"Who cares and why do you go there? That‚Äôs not your problem. You go back to your country. God was poor, ever forget that? Huh? Aljazeera? Liar!"
Please learn our languages before u come to Philippines I&#39;m tired if this foreigner coming to Philippines don&#39;t wanna learn our language but when  we come to there  countries we have to learn there&#39;s
Why is this country so dirty. Is not the citizen fault is the government .not even the Africa countries or subamerican look that bad please help those children
It&#39;s simple. You don&#39;t all have to be Catholic. There are several other religions in the Philippines. Other religions don&#39;t share the views of the Catholic church. That&#39;s the only way to break the stronghold of the Catholic church. The less people attending services will force them to be desperate and change Look at France. Spain and Italy they were once staunch Catholic countries. Now they all suffer from low population. No one can stop them from using birth control. If the Philippines doesn&#39;t do something about population explosion they are doomed.
Can Aljazeera make a film about Islam&#39;s rapid population increase in European countries to replace Europe&#39;s declining and aging population. I believe there&#39;s more &quot;baby factory&quot; production in this continent than anywhere else.
Instead of educating the students..the person sud educate on slums and all those poor areas...
Why aren&#39;t these pedophiles in prison?
TF 12 talaga nasa constitution bat hindi pa amyendahan yan
This is...a mess...
Oh my god it is.......
This is the darkest documentary I have ever seen.
"I feel sad for MeiMei thinking she&#39;s at fault, she should be remanded she herself is a child."
I worry about those teenagers who are not pregnant yet..those who were I don&#39;t cause I know how strong and positive filipino are no matter what.they will get through it.
Poverty and lack of education this is the result.. teenage pregnancy. Very common specially in slums areas.
This is so effed up. Letting male predators prey on underage girls. Unbelievable!
This is what happens when you fight the access to birth control while avoiding any kind of related education but keep thinking not knowing and no access would somehow prevent it from happening
Bahala na! God will provide if they go to church every Sunday and pray very hard like good Catholics. They are only poor because they don&#39;t pray hard enough......pray till you have cramp in your neck and callouses on your knees!
And am 15 and complaining about getting new yeezy shame on me

Jesus Chris never ask you not to use contraceptives
just show the kids at age 12 the videos of women giving  natural birth and how painful it looks.. that would probably scare the living lights out of them...
"Lol its because there are streotypes and discrimination when people see you buy condoms, contraceptives and pregnancy test kits in my country. That&#39;s why many get pregnant, they are unprotected and naive."
Sad.
"ahh, the catholic church and it&#39;s plague"
It is only when the people learn how to separate religion from governing logic will Philippines ever have a chance to get itself together.
stop spreading lies where is the legel concent 12 fock u
I don&#39;t support abortion but at least she is aware the fetus is in fact a human life.
"I don&#39;t know where to start with this.. I can&#39;t support this but at the same time these children are so uneducated, I feel like its the systems fault for not stepping up and this children are essentially victims. <br>Can I donate to them? Anyone know?"
Thats gotta be hard on their economy...sad!
this is why I question my religion how can u say all life is important when there are millions of children that born in poverty line and just ends up suffering.
wtf:(
"That&#39;s how third countries are going to run out of resources, more are born everyday, but school welfare and basic sanitation do not follow. Religion is killing the Philippines."
This is disturbing..The government must do something.ASAP :-(
"Filipino women are still very feminine not like their male counterparts in western world. Sure not everything about philippines is great, but when it comes to women, they still respect their husband, fathers, and men; something that the western world hates."
:o
EU should allow Philippines migration.
"I got a solution, you left an underage girl pregnant: you pay fine.<br> you dont want to pay the fine? :<br>6 months of force lavor. <br>The girl gets government aid and they makes sure she finnish school."
Look how excited the white lady was when she found out she could get quick and easy abortions. That culture of death mentality is the reason why Europeans are dying off around the globe in droves.
Thanks to God we have clear law for society.
Don‚Äôt have babies you can‚Äôt pay for Jesus
The big irony is just outside the church people can buy herbal concoctions and pharmaceutical meds to terminate pregnancies. I&#39;m confused. Why doesn&#39;t the clergy do anything about it?
Totally distracted by the spinster&#39;s totally mismatched eyebrows...

I don&#39;t think so.
"Pro Life? You can hardly call the life of these ‚Äúchild‚Äù mothers to be (Pro) Life - what hope is there for those young adults and their children, it saddens me deeply that these children cannot get sexual education and contraception because of those in power and their religious beliefs. Kids having kids, no education, lifelong poverty üò¢"
Imagine that flooded water dirty
"Duterte should ban religion or dismantle the church. If you don&#39;t destroy the church, they will destroy you and your country. That&#39;s really how powerful the church is. You make a wrong move that is against their views, they threaten revolution. Wow. how is the church more powerful than Duterte? He and his govt can&#39;t even legally distribute condoms or family planning lectures without the church&#39;s interference."
üò§
Terrible üò©
Sheer shrewd Political move of Imperialist Church Nobles.
Don&#39;t they have condoms?
These girls need to go to school. only higher education can fix this
"it should not be a woman&#39;s right to have children, overpopulation affects any nation and a child affects everyone around. how could it be a right when they cant even feed them?"
That guy lecturing about abstinence to those middle school kids is soooooo cringey.
This must be stop.
Can someone tag this video to CBCP
Religion &amp; politics is a dangerous mixture !!! It takes away your logics ...  <br>look at the girls saying- i wont use contraceptive because i am catholic !!
They&#39;ll have to compete with the Arabs for resources when the white people are gone.
This is quite a chock because in pre colonial philipines abounding in children was a disgrace this sort of nothing never happened
I think I should stop complain about China population control policy.

As filipino citizen i hate that the church is not separated to the state .
Good grief üôÑ
it is serious story to understand all the sides mean concept is debatable.........
Let the Philippines sort themselves out. If they want to have children so be it. They should though not expect to migrate to another country and breed there. Western values should stay in western countries or those countries that they have colonised and imposed their will upon.
that is lies the legal age in the philippines is 18 not 12. why is she telling lies
I am sorry that their govt did not implement the poverty teen pregnancies and unwed mothers.
This is what happens when religion rules over logic
"wow, for being so poor, there&#39;s still a lot of attractive women. Best looking Asians after the Japanese."
"We have the RH Law that provides free contraception to all Filipinos, but it hasnt been implemented yet due to a lack of funds. Hopefully President Duterte will speed that up because he is in favor of it, and 70% of Filipinos are in favor of the law too. So dont believe any BS about Filipinos being against contraceptives. <br><br>Also, the average woman in the Philippines has 2.94 children. This number has been dropping every year for decades. In 1970, it was 6.15."
"So that one guy left his wife and children behind just like that and that girl and her parents are ok with that?! He cheated on his wife, he made their 14 year old daughter pregnant and seems to lie about his own age. It won&#39;t surprise me if he&#39;s gone in a year or so because he made an other child pregnant.<br><br>This docu is so disturbing, how can the parents not educate their children when they see what happens if they don&#39;t all the time. They are not sure if their daughters are allowed to be on birth control, well why don&#39;t you ask a doctor? And besides why is it even the girls problem alone? It takes two to tango and the boy could have used condoms and be educated on how to use those properly."
"Meimei needs to understand that it was not her fault, if god is benevolent he could never be ashamed of her. She is just a child that needs her parents."
"Jesus Christ. There is so much wrong with that Philippines situation, I&#39;m not sure where to start."
I feel sorry to those children/teenagers who got pregnant... as a Filipino teenager I&#39;m very thankful of where I am now.... hopefully they will fight and take this kind of responsibility at this early age....
This is so sad and disturbingüò≠üò≠üò¢üò¢

Boddle eat is fun eating
"Hi, it&#39;s nice to see this video sharing the military tradition... so others may know, the word &quot;BOODLE&quot; originated in the United States Military Academy also known as West Point. This military terminology called boodle means food. This U.S. military jargon was adopted by the Philippine Military Academy, Philippine Air Force Flying School, and Philippine Merchant Marine Academy. Military Cadets in their 4th class (1st Year) in the military academy or military schools usually cannot eat well because of the military tradition called the square meal. What these cadets do is gather at night at sneak (It&#39;s called take life). They collect all the boodles they can easily provide like noodles, sardines, rice, and other instant meal, and put them in a newspaper (not banana leaf). Once the noodles are prepared, the cadets start to commence the &quot;Boodle Fight&quot;_. The cadets can sleep with a good load of food after they take life. The Filipino tradition is called &quot;KAMAYAN&quot; using the coconut shell as their plate.<br><br>The United States Marines called it &quot;CHOW&quot; which was also adopted by the Philippine Marines and Philippine Merchant Marines Academy Cadets."
"I don&#39;t like seafood much, so I wouldn&#39;t eat most of what he eats. I hate cooking shows too. But for some reason I really enjoy this."

"The big fish was Napoleon fish,it&#39;s really tasty,in my family we call it chicken fish because the meat is similar to chicken but softer,it&#39;s pretty pricey but worth it."
Depressed you didn&#39;t take the chance to try &#39;the durian of the sea&#39; lol
"LECHON WAS FORGOTTEN BECAUSE OF THE TERRIBLE EFFECT TO HEALTH , BUT GAINED POPULARITY IN DINER AND CATERINGS . IF YOU WANT TO HAVE LONGER LIFE , AVOID .<br><br>_WILSON"
"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, the big blue fish was a Humphead Wrasse (Napoleon Fish). Interesting fact, they can switch back and forth between male/female."
Wow amazing food
boodle fight is more fun with all hands creeping in :D
Why you like poodle fight<br><br>Inday pagbilhan hopia
Huy bastos! I need at least a hundred quid for that.
He has never seen a lechon on boodle fight? Lol are u even a filipino? Haha

What $100 gets you in the Philippines As I have been saying years ago, I was assigned to the Philippines several times in the 60s, 70s, and 80s during my active duty service as a KGB analyst intelligence officer under a diplomatic cover. And I took advantage of my rank to move around that country. It also reminds me of my assignment to Tahiti!"
"I have never seen a boodle fight even though I&#39;m Filipino and &#39;m a broken one at that.<br>Now, I have never been to the Philippines because I live on Maui and I only know limited Filipino people like my friend&#39;s family and my own family. And I only have seen very little Filipino culture through family gatherings and events so this video is very interesting because I now know a little bit more of my own culture"
even the grilled chicken intestines on the street taste good too and the dinuguan. it&#39;s the balut that i will never try although i heard a lot of people love it. i love Filipino food! the Boddle Fight is awesome too. the idea of it friends/relatives/family eating together i think is heart-warming üòä
Binaguan na intestines masarap yan but nakakahiya lang dyan machines letchon sila but tayo di paa I Hope malinis yan para hindi nakakahiya üòä The best yan in the Philippines budol Fight üòÅ
Pag di na maintindihan Yes nalang hahaha
"Day 2, watching your videos bout food review in the Philippines."
"Dayok, you need to add calamansi and sili, so that it will taste perfect"
"Papi is the dude to be with when you go out to eat - he‚Äôs so welcoming and encouraging, he just wants you to savor those flavors &lt;3"

I wish Sonny Visit Iloilo
Who still watching this.¬ø‚Ä¶.Kalami sa Litson uy‚Ä¶.
Local has foreigner to eat a disgusting condiment the local himself has not even tried.
"Let me tour here in my city,Ormoc City,Leyte,Philippines."
LOVE THIS!!
"The exotic otherness from a white gaze feels much more like privilege than about the food. The felt sense in this channel so much from a¬† post-colonial stance, where the other is so exotic, ethnic than about food they have that is weirder from us. I am so amazed how so many people of colour try to impress or create the most outlandish food for him. There&#39;s is something not right here.¬† It is like a food zoo, like a human zoo"
you always want some food you fucker
Hahaha lagyan kasi ng suka yung dayok para mijo mawala yung alat ü§£
Definitely not $100

Philippines being seperated from mainland asia makes their food very unique. Sort of like a mix of hispanic and asian.
"Awww, love this video!!!!!!!!!! Love from the Philippines!"
"You should return to the philippines, find a good tour guide, preferably multi dialectual and experience  the north. You&#39;re missing out on the amount of amazing dishes that remain from older generations. From meat, vegetables and fruit dishes.<br><br>Just like mindanao, much of luzon wasn&#39;t colonized by the Spanish up to american so you&#39;ll still find a variety of old dishes. Showing this to preserve the slowly disappearing old cuisine of the north.<br><br><br><br>All i could say is you&#39;re visit was too &#39;safe&#39; but with the places you visited recently i think it&#39;s gonna be fine."
Is that big fish mameng?.just asking.
So yummyüòã
"CORRECTION: 1. That is not Lechon de Leche. That lechon is already full size. Lechon de Leche is about a month old pig. 2. The egg is not century egg. It&#39;s salted egg or itlog na maalat. Century egg shell is light gray and inside, the inside is almost black."
"The moment he said to the camera man&quot;you can put that down, we gotta eat&quot;. That was so amazing part dude. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4AjFOMQXE&amp;t=11m15s"">11:15</a>"

I Taught it was bogart!
"Dude parrot fish should not be eaten, damn"
"MMmmmmm seafood products, hot muggy weather...  Bagooooooooooong!  The ingredient of terror.  Just some HIGHLY PERISHABLE fish products that have been sitting out in the parking lot for a year or so.  I think this is an example of a class of foods that won&#39;t spoil... because it was already spoiled when you bought it!   I have known what bagoong IS for many years, but didn&#39;t actually eat any until a few days ago, as a seasoning in Bicol Express, a dish in a Pinoy takeout food place.  The dish was pork in coconut milk sauce, flavored and colored PINK by bagoong.  Wow!  It had everything!  Hot, smelly, salty, rich and oily, and it&#39;s pieces of pork belly so you have to love THAT.  I was a little scared but I got over it!  I&#39;m saying that the little bit of Philippine food we get here in the states makes me want to GO THERE.  The desserts are good too, and pretty alien."
love the sense of humor! üòÇ
the Flowerhorn fish is so big
Stop buying /eating / catching parrot fish people =(
"Bizzara food in India northeast ,Bodo culture classic dishes,  in  Bongaigaon assam  dishes like  ~giants bats, rats , frog, hare, snail, silkworm&#39;s , snake like fish, fox , crap , narjai OMA , and hundred other traditional epic dishes 90% of indians have no idea at all , next time if u look for bizzara food in India try  visit Bongaigaon Assam India ,&amp; the  best part is everything is fresh &amp;  local &amp; very cheap"

atleast these videos actually give justice to FIlipino food cause you&#39;re eating food from the Philippines not some poorly made dishes made by foreigners who don&#39;t really know how to prepare it.

Hey man I&#39;m a fan of your channel I just wanna know what is the title of the song of your intro. Thanks
What is the title of your intro song
What is the title of the song in your intro? Thanks
"Whenever my family holds boodle fights we hardly have any seafood, only fish and shrimp. We also don&#39;t have lechon, it&#39;s veryy expensive at where I live. We usually have homemade diniguan and ribs, and many more, whatever reaches our budget, lol."
"I came here after watching you from erwan&#39;s. I told myself i&#39;ll just watch a few of your videos but ended up finishing more than 20. Lol. Hope you can also make a collab with Mikey Bustos. He&#39;s a funny guy, and i think a video with him would be great."
Interesting
this guy is good ..
Don‚Äôt forget the riceü§£ü§£ü§£
Go to Netflix
Like.üôã<br> if you think sonny is the best food reviewer .
"we love watching your food vlogs, great job."
I like this food guy the best because he doesn&#39;t pretend everything tastes amazing. Nothing in life excites me more than food.
"&quot;Suck the heads for more pleybor&quot; <br>Filipino accent, man üòÇ"
Dayok is good with chop red onion and chilli with lime
"&quot;Madam,your squid  is looking very respectable .I like it ,very big and plum and  I&#39;ts ready to be stuffed with delicious cheeses &quot; , double entendres to the max :P :P"
That guy laugh killed me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Your guide doesn&#39;t know how to eat Dayok! It is supposed to be mixed with spices ( onions, ginger, chili) kalamansi and vinegar. You are not supposed to eat it as if it is viand. It is supposed to be a condiment or dip only. Not to be eaten directly like how you did it. It is unfortunate you had to go through that experience and ruin the reputation of the venerated dayok haha."
Why don&#39;t you try some pancit here at the Philippines
My new favorite channel
Lechon - the king of Filipino festive dishes
you&#39;re like logan paul but with respect.
thats expensive
What is the name of the ending song?
Hahahahaaa√† suck the head broüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Can&#39;t believe you Compared a Tasty Smol Cherry to a Huge  Lechon
Did you all wash your hands before eating?  Hmmmmmm???
oh hoho what a great food video :)
$50 is enough
I&#39;m starving my mothers uncle   is making lechon
Philippines is the best
Labyur vids
Hey sonny I&#39;m your subcriber from Phillip welcome to my country delicious cusin and wonderful island
Or try lechon baka you will not regret it üòâ
"You are badass man lol. I venture to go to as many places as you, I will succeed! Lol"
Your talk like Shane McMahon
A very heavy cherry üçí
We need you to tell us what the heck oceany means
"&quot;Don&#39;t forget the rice!&quot;... that&#39;s absolutely right. With such heavy flavors, everything always go pretty well with rice."
Putok batok is in the neck
"$100 In the PHILIPPINES?  that doesn&#39;t represent &quot;the entire philippines&quot;! you had it in PALAWAN which is far from the reality of the rest of the Philippines! crabs are at $15 per kilo, a prawn is at $15 per kilo, white squids are at $6 per kilo. It would have been more correct if you had it &quot;$100 in Palawan&quot;...  It&#39;s this kind of confusing and misleading titles for views and for keyword relevance that makes people from abroad think that everything in the Philippines is cheap! Lechon alone is at $140-$160 for a whole one! and when people abroad thinks of Palawan, they think everything is cheap when the description doesn&#39;t inform viewers that these are price rates around palawan and doesn&#39;t represent Palawan itself since El Nido or Amnpulo and many other places do cost more etc. just subscribed earlier but now... UNSUBSCRIBING. not your loss... still have 562k subs and almost 800k views."
youre road
you deserve your own show

"Wow! This is one of the best food review I&#39;ve ever seen... Not only because of the fact that I came form the Philippines, but also the variety of food, placed in one table, in a manner of boodle fight...  It&#39;s so yummy and delicious, specially when the ingredients are native... So happy that many shows/vlogs have so much positive reviews about the quality/ taste of foods here; furthermore, the PRICE...Well, for us Filipinos, 100dollars is roughly 5100+ pesos rightnow, and it&#39;s hard to earn though... But you have my high appreciation about your show, how you&#39;re very nice to different people and races... It&#39;s a 10/10 in ratings for me."
Fck eto ang mamimiss ko sa pilipinas pag umuwi na akong japan. Boodle fight!!

Lechon de Leche is actually roasting a young pig...the meat is more tender than an adult when roasted properly.<br>You can eat more servings in a Boodle Fight than what you expect. Its probably since no plate is being used during that time.

Wow!
"Oh man, I wished I was already subbed to you when you were in palawan, I live there...."
"You did it the Filipino way...friendly, generosity, hospitality, happy, stress free, groupy, tasty, crunchy, locally and abundantly. I bet every pnoy  would agree with me. :)"

"the dayok or fish intestine should be partnered with some calamansi and after that, you need to have a shot of a whisky or any alcoholic beverage that is why it is always being prepared in any drinking session or pulutan as what we call it."
How come no women at the boodle fight?

"Im a filipino and a student studying in another country, watching this you just made me hungry, I want to go homeüò≠üòÇ"
Seagrapes looks interesting. Does it taste good? Never tried one!
"Not all Filipinos tasted Dayoc, fermented fish intestine, but it would definitely taste a bit salty and strong vinegary. Well, the boodle fight is very familiar, though. It is traditionally a food eaten when we are on a beach. All those variety seafoods, fish, shrimps, crabs, seaweed veges, okra and the vinegar sawsawan , and you eat with your hands ( must wash thoroughly), and share with family in friends and do not forget the cool sea breeze, very intimate, relaxing and fun way of eating with your loved ones."
I‚Äôm Filipino but I live in the us and I LOVE LECHON it‚Äôs cooked pig and other Filipino food he ate
Sarap
Heyy Besty ... üòòüòòüòòüòò I really love your videos .. And thankyou for visiting our country again .. Hope you&#39;ll do a meet and greet day

"This guy is so legit, I think he is the only person that gives back to the community that he was staying with, I have respect for this guy cos there is not many IF ANY you tubers that give back such as a simple meal to the people around him, all I see others do is show off how much food they have knowing the locals can not afford it and could only watch, yeah you all know who you are no doubt about it. Compassion is a powerful thing and yeah come to New Zealand some day, that‚Äôs how we roll."
My gosh ..thats delicious

Foreigners making money in the Philippines. Wearing red around their forehead to make it seem like they are great. But they are all sisies just trying to make youtube money. Take those things off and just film. You are definitely advertising their location and let all perverted people come and explore this place. Advertising good things of Filipinoes so foreigner can take advantage of these good old Folks. Respect is needed.

"Being Japanese, calling that big fish &quot;Looks like it&#39;s from Fukushima&quot; citing the natural disaster,  was not pleasant.<br>Though I love food, so I continued watching."
Ohhh I&#39;m hungry nowüòÇüòÇüòÇüò¢üò¢üò¢
Yup! &quot;Dont forget eating the rice.&quot;
wow
"Hi Sonny. You are correct - it is a military tradition but the history goes even more than having cadets stand and take up the tastiest piece of meat.<br>In the 1960s or earlier, the more senior cadets would take a large bag or plate of rice from the mess hall and take it to their rooms.  They would spread it on the floor or table and open whatever tin of food or place leftovers on top of the rice. <br>Since it was lights out by that time, they would eat in the dark and scoop up as much as they can at the quickest possible time.  Hence the fight."
Damn who knew a whole pig could still look so delicious
sarap
"What i hate with eating in the PH is the damn flies everywhere, nasty. And you the man Sonny @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4AjFOMQXE&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> and the fermented guts.....Fear Factor right there :D"

Great content Sonny..
I suggest in Puerto Galera if you go snorkling or something you will stop in one small island where there is not alot of people and with a little climb up cave in it  but sometimes there would be a guy carying a bucket and filled withe sea urchens and you can buy it from him and you can eat it
"Watching you eat those fish guts had me screaming into my hands, damn, you are one brave meat expert"
wow! delicious!
"The Pleasure of food,, i wanna try it,, make me Hungry,,"
"Wow amazing seafood.  I am not that much into seafood, but the stuff in this video looks amazing. Thanks for sharing."
Great video as usual. This should be trending by now.
Why is it when a person in the Philippines has someone try something they look like they&#39;ve never tried it themselves? They have the concerned look.

"Hey Sonny! ¬† You should come to Tokyo and do a 7-11, Family Mart, and Lawson&#39;s video of Best Ever Food. ¬†We live in Tokyo and when I don&#39;t have time to cook we just eat convenience store food and it&#39;s pretty good. ¬†Otherwise you need to do a Japan food video soon. I rarely write comments on Youtube but I really love your videos compared to Mark and Mike your video is so much better funnier and better quality. ¬†Peace."
"Hey Sonny! The next time you come over to the Philippines, can you announce it first so that we can book a flight to wherever you are gonna be? lol! Or so much better if you explore the North next time around cause that&#39;s where I&#39;m from. Cheers to more humor filled vlogs!"

We have our own version of that soup in Cebu called &quot;LANSIAO&quot; and more delicious &amp; potent than the chinese soup # 5.  If you happen to come<br>back to Cebu, the best people whom you can ask were the find the best Lansiaos are the Taxi and Jeepney drivers.  Hope to see a video on this.  Thanks."

<b>I LOVE BOODLE FIGHT</b> üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
"You ate the dayok wrong! It was supposed to be partnered with rice. You also don&#39;t need that many for it will be very salty and sour, you only need bits of it spread around the rice."
Nicely done as always!
Makes me hungry and craving for more lechon and seafoods.
"Pls try going to the northest part of luzon.. especially in ilocos try those ilocano delicacies like papaitan, dinakdakan, ilocos longganisa, miki, empanada, and many more.."
"That lechon looks soooo good. I imagine the fermented fish guts are like bagoong isda, it&#39;s supposed to be a dip and not eaten on its own. But you gotta mix some lime/vinegar and chilies with it first then dunk some boiled or grilled okra and eggplants."
Lets do this!
The fish intestines is not yet finished fermenting. It will turn into a special bagoong after 2 weeks. Better bagoong than those anchovy-made bagoong.
"Man, I love your videos! Cause your down to earth and your keeping it real....."
Sonny have ever had a parasites in your  tummy?with all these weird food you‚Äôve been eating you could have had at least.
Oh my gosh! You&#39;re in my country!!
M here eating veg...sob sob

"Yooo, I‚Äôd say come to Cagayan De Oro but it sucks here lol. I don‚Äôt really know what we have here that‚Äôs a delicacy. I mean there‚Äôs a few good eats here but nothing too unique."
MAH MAAAAN! This is seriously the best ever food review show! Got mad respect for you! YOU EVEN TRIED DAYOK! BOMB ASS CONDIMENT SPECIALLY WITH HOT STEAMING RICE! You need more subscribers like a couple million more!

Ahahahaha so entertaining!!
Everything about this food show is just so good
"You are eating dayok wrong. It is a fermented fish, similar to bagoong. You add calamansi, tomatoes, sili and then eat a little with rice. That&#39;s better than bagoong."
"i don&#39;t know why im here , best part is lechon crunchiness ü§§ . you got my sub and likes"
just who the hell would eat dayok with no rice to pair lol.

"You are eating a lot of exotic Filipino dishes that even most Filipinos (especially those living overseas) have not even tried yet. Kudos to you. I hope you enjoyed your culinary trip to the Philippines and explore more of the islands beyond Cebu and Palawan. There&#39;s still several other islands with their own unique dishes you have to try out. You&#39;ll discover that Filipinos will tend to show more genuine hospitality to a total stranger compared to other countries you have traveled to, especially in the less urban areas."
"I used to watch only Mark Weins and Trevor James The food ranger, But recently came across yourself and now you are up there with them in my viewing watching pleasure, Love it great videos and quality!!"

Looks so good!
Now that is what we called... real Filipino Experience!
Don‚Äôt forget to make the head of the pig into sisig after and then lechon paksiw the leftover parts of the pig. No waste lol.
Sonny really got that Asian squat down! lol
"&quot;Just suck the head...&quot;<br>&quot;Usually it&#39;s like 6 or 8 inches only, but this is the biggest one I&#39;ve ever seen...&quot;<br>&quot;One of my favorites is stuffing &#39;things&#39; in a squid and leaving &#39;cheese&#39; in it...&quot;<br>Are you sure these lines aren&#39;t scripted? lol"
epic episode as always
Food Looks good dang
I didn&#39;t know that that was the best part of the Lechon either. Now I do. üòã

we need more longer your video.. hahaha please shoot Kai face.. :D
Dang...<br><br>-Sonny Side
"Gotta say Sonny, your show totally lives up to its name. <br><br>Love the quality, love your enthusiasm and humor, love that you&#39;re giving focus on lesser known cuisines like Filipino and Vietnamese food. <br><br>I think Bourdain and Zimmern are great, but I also like that your show is more from the perspective of an extremely adventurous every-man and not necessarily a trained chef. It gives off a more rustic, humble atmosphere, in my opinion."
literally went home from school early just to binge watch your vids which is what i&#39;m doing rn<br>p.s. it&#39;s 1 :56 am and a school night
"Oh man, all that food looked amazing! But I&#39;d especially love to try the stuffed squid! üòã"

Well at least you were in t3 and not t1
They let you spend all night in the airport? Thatz good to know.
I had a similar situation on my last trip . The Uber driver caused me to get to the airport late and they would not let me board the plane . I went upstairs and booked another ticket for the same time the next day . Which cost me almost the same as my original round-trip ticket . I got to the airport very early the next night . Spent hours in the airport . My flight home was late to board . Makes you wonder ? Still love the Philippines ! Just hate the hustle .
We have Jollibee in NYC. The chicken ain&#39;t so bad but I love Popeyes. How was the strawberry French fries?
"My question is, you travel, make great videos for all to see, but I find it odd that a young good looking couple can survive, travel, and vacation with no job?  How does one do it?"
"I heard Strawberry French Fries was a dud. People did not like it. Frankly speaking, Jollibee is just like McDonalds. Many Filipino kids grew up eating that akin to many kids in the US, once upon a time, grew up with McDonalds. So, there goes the emotional attachment. There is McDonalds in the Philippines but Jollibee knows its market like the palm of the hand. So, in the Philippines, Jollibee beat McDonald&#39;s in its own game. Not really a fan of either but they are available and convenient when you really need to eat."
"You guys did well to cope with a full 24 hours in MAIA.  The reputation the Manila airport has for being the worst in Asia is well deserved, at least terminal 2 which is exclusively for PAL."
Poor souls you&#39;ve tried the strawberry fries.
Jollibee &lt;3

There&#39;s nothing worse than a long layover when you are tired and just want to be home - good to see you made it safely xo
"One of those days huh , those are soul crushing . I Remember being stuck in phuket airport for 16 hours that was great fun lol , <br>Enjoy you two x"
"Now you got that travel mishap out of the way, it&#39;s hopefully smooth sailing from here on ^^ I love watching travel days and mishaps are all part of the adventure... suppose it&#39;s hard to see it that way when you are in the situation"
I&#39;m sure by now your girl is already sick and tired of being mistaken as a filipina....lol
I&#39;m late
"Excellent video! Including the conversation with the lady made my day. For the most part, everyone is sooooo friendly. Good info about the photographer luggage. I bought a &quot;press&quot; vest just go complete the story if I&#39;m ever questioned."

Oishi (Oy she if you like to pronounce the Japanese way or Oh wee she). Boy bawang (boy buh wong) Cebu is a close neighbor of Boracay. Polvoron might have been taken from the word pulverized because it‚Äôs sweet powder. Pinipig (pee knee pig). Choc nut (chalk nut)
Tru VCUT.its good
"Those snacks are good..yummy!!!esp the polvoron,hopia and chippy..Try halohalo,turon and some dessert=)"
this is funny. everything is ube flavored. :)) i hope someone can get you a whole llanera of ube halaya. :)
Oishi goes well with beer.
Our most beautiful fellow filipino in the US is Layne Fable. ‚ò∫ glad you enjoyed the filipino snacks guys..
You can get all these items and more from your local asian grocery stores...
Guyabano or Sour soup in English a superfood. Just try the real one and youll be amaze how its good and nutritious.üòâ

"From Philippines here, and I‚Äôm loving your vlogs since I watched your Jollibee test 1. I‚Äôm currently in Finland, watching your videos away from Philippines makes me wanna book a flight going back home lol, just kidding. Though, yes it makes me missing those foods and I happened to be stuck on your channel when I search Filipino foods video. Kudos to you Layne and Family, God bless you. <br><br>Btw, you can try making your own polvoron because I used to make it before, the ingredients can be easily searched in google: mainly powedered milk, sugar, flour and the rest are flavorings. And.. bawang is Tagalog of garlic.."

"Hi Layne,<br><br>To begin with, I&#39;m from the Philippines. üòä This is actually your very first vlog I&#39;ve watched. Honestly, I&#39;m not a huge fan of watching vlogs but when I saw this, I was like &quot;OMG, she&#39;s good at this!&quot;. So I&#39;ve decided to hit subscribe just yesterday (May 26, 2019) üòÇ and watched your Jollibee taste test E1 vlog with your whole family in Hawaii and up until now I couldn&#39;t stop watching the rest of your vlogs especially here in the Philippines.

The guy in the middle is so cute. For me he looks like Alexander stewart.
Try eating pansit canton
"Just wondering, have you tried ube jam?"
"STICK-O! the purpose of having 2 or 3 sticks on plastic is so that it becomes easier for the consumer to pull a couple out [the sticks inside the plastic] without breaking a single stick as each stick is delicate and can break sooner than anyone would expect, also the sticks are tightly packed in the container to avoid the swaying of sticks from end to end (to really avoid breaking the stick). tl;dr the plastic makes it easier to pull out the first few sticks so that the rest would be pulled out quicker"
Nice
on the stick-o part . there  is a plastic with three stick-o inside for you to easily get one. you just pull the plastic.
Ang Cute nyo. üòç you look like Gal Gadot. I like yor Channel üíï

"As much as I like Goldilocks&#39; cakes, I really wouldn&#39;t say that they&#39;re the best when it comes to polvoron. <br><br>The local polvoron would break and turn powdery when you bite into it. The best ones though would crumble by just holding it.<br><br>I really enjoyed this vid. Gonna binge-watch more of them now lol.<br><br>Here&#39;s how you say them by the way... Oishi is O-wee-she. Bawang is bah-wang. Pinipig is Pi-NEE-pig.<br><br>Also here are some local Filipino  snacks I recommend for you to try (haven&#39;t seen all of your vids but hopefully you still haven&#39;t tried some of these)...<br>-Macapuno<br>-Pastillas/pastilyas (the best ones are made of carabao&#39;s milk<br>-Espasol<br>-Ube jam (I noticed you like ube) and Peanut Brittle (the best ones are those from Baguio)<br>-Philippine chips namely Piattos, V-Cut, Chicharon ni Mang Juan/Marty&#39;s Cracklings (they basically taste the same)<br>-Philippine biscuits/cookies/pastries like Dowee (the blue ones are the best), Monde Mamon (preferrably the strawberry cream-filled one), Fudgee Barr, and Lemon&#39;s Square Cheesecake.<br><br>And I DARE you to try Durian candy. Not a lot of people, even Filipinos, like it but it&#39;s still a must try.<br><br>I absolutely love your videos! Hoping you can try some of these."

"Perfect! You have Eng Bee Tin there! It&#39;s a famous brand here in the Philippines, look for the ube custard flavor üòä it&#39;s gooood"
"Oishi=oweshee : Hopia red mungo=Red Bean cake;  Boy Bawang= Boy Ba-Wang (Garlic); Guyabano juice (you can buy them in in multiple quantity  even a whole box like 24 in a case, it&#39;s cheaper here in CANADA); Ube Pillows , polvoron is made of powdered milk;  Pini-pig (pinipig), Corn nuts snack (dingdong); stikos ( those are sold in regular stores not just Filipino stores); it&#39;s actually  Choc-nut ( Chok nut) every kid loves those"
Ube Pillows are Taro Root snack. It will screw up the taste if ur drinking something from Starbucks
All Filipino snacks are good...... those stuff u can buy in Filipino stores.
Actually the purpose of the separated pcs of wrapped stick o is to pull them first so you can pull the other stick o&#39;s easier.
Bawang in English is garlic
Owww ei shie..thats how you say it
"You totally love ube , dont you ?"
Enjoyed watching thiss! ‚ù§üáµüá≠
stick-o snack You must feel great enough if you saw the part where some sticks still in a plastic wrapper in the middle coz it means that youre the first one to open the jar and thats the first part to pull in order to get another one.....
thank you for eat filipono snuk foodüòäüòä
The reason why there is some stik o place in a wrapper is for you to pull it up so that you can easily get the other stik o&#39;s üòä

Now you guys makes me hungry üòã

You should not be scared to some Filipino who says bad stuff just because you said your honest reactions. We love you no matter what. It‚Äôs better to be honest to be lying because when a person lied to you it‚Äôs like they betrayed you but when a person is honest to you it means they want you to learn or they care!
Pinipigs are rice crispy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

You should come to the Philippines again! But this time you should come to the province called &quot;Pampanga&quot; it&#39;s the culinary capital of the Philippines. I&#39;m more than willing to be your tour guide

"It&#39;s Boy Ba - Wang, not Boy Bawong. Lol"
Awesome filipino snack taste test..cant wait for your dads turn

"Try going to an Asian supermarket in NYC or something and look for ‚Äúsour sop‚Äù, which is the English name for guyabano!"
Boy Bawang best with vinegar!!! :)
I think they have guyabano in some Asian or Spanish stores
"Oishi: Shane pronounced it right the first time. It&#39;s actually Japanese which means delicious<br>Polvoron: You usually eat this with tea or black coffee. The Pinipig is the crunchy one. Delish.<br><br>Most of these snacks can be eating with alcohol (the salty, garlicy ones) and tea/coffee (the sweet ones)."
You are such a goodlooking family! I hope you can visit the Philippines again. Ill be waiting for you guys here ‚ò∫üôè

"&quot;It tastes like Play-doh a little.&quot; How does she know how Play-Doh tastes like? I know what paste tastes like but I gotta admit never trying Play-Doh. The Boy Bawang corn kernel things go GREAT with beer. Layne you can get actual Guyabano (aka Soursop) at Chinatown Fruit Stands on Canal Street in Tribeca. Other places The Met Food in Jackson Heights 7610 37th Ave,  Liberato supermarket Washington Heights 3900 Broadway, New York City, NY 10031 (212) 927-8250, Food Bazaar<br>Bedford Stuyvesant 1102 Myrtle Ave Brooklyn, NY 11206 Phone number (718) 919-0197.<br><br>Pinipig is toasted immature grains of rice. Stick-O&#39;s are good with tea or coffee."
Oishii is Japanese for delicious.
"Nice one. Filipino snacks again. :) Yey! You love us, Layne and Shane. John approved video."
Have you tried bibingka? I want to order them it‚Äôs new item that ships from filstop!
Ding dong üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
shane üò≠
Oishi is my fave!üòç
"Since you like Ube so much, I think you owe it to yourself to find the root crop itself.  When you do finally get your hands on some, go find someone who you know makes a great sweet potato pie and tell them to make it out of the Ube root.  It&#39;s best to ask them how much it takes to make a pie though before you go out and buy some.<br><br>At least you can tell yourself that you know of the real Ube itself and not just processed versions of it.  It is very common for people who make Ube go and dilute it with sweet potato as an extender.  Also, I don&#39;t know of anybody who eats it in its boiled unsweetened state.<br><br>Ube is also called Taro and there&#39;s some on Amazon.  It&#39;s not purple though.  I haven&#39;t tried the white Ube which seems weird because I grew up identifying it with the color purple.  If you see the Taro Bubble Tea on Amazon, grab that and see if you like it."
Thank you for considering all my suggestion. You made my day Layne!üòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è
Choc-Nut in the freezer? Let me try that.
Lol I have Guyabano juice sitting in my kitchen

I cant believe Mark bailed!! Hahaha
Wow my fav stik-o ang ding dong!  ;) absolutly shane love the oishi :) :D
"CHOC NUT is an all time fave! Uhm, Layne, where was Quinn? LOL üòã"
Pinipig is like or a relative of rice crispies i think

"Obviously, Shane loves Oishi haha"
"DingDong is my all time favorite, especially with beer on the side üòÇ"
Shane is so cute üòç and funny üòã and hot üî•

"If you plan to go back in the Philippines,<br>check the channel of Lost LeBlanc for his<br>TOP 10 PHILIPPINES (Your DREAM Destination)"
Pinipig is rice crispy ‚ò∫
Pinipig = rice crispy<br>Guyabano = sour sop
I miss eating filipino snacks....Hi from LA
"I suggest for Hopia, either Eng Bee Tin(www.engbeetin.com) or Tipas Bakery Hopia. Every Filipino kid of the 90s knows Tipas Bakery Hopia. For polvoron to answer &quot;what is pinipig?&quot;, it is a toasted immature rice grain. normally used as topping for ice cream or halo-halo. There is also a chocnut flavor for polvoron just like the last snack but not as good.  Love you both! I love how you have loved our country, our food and the people. More power!"
I just got some Mango Balls from Fil Stop!
The guayabano juice is available in all filipino stores in the U.S.

"Hi, Layne. Angelo here from Long Beach. That‚Äôs a lotta snacks. The only one I remember when I was a kid back home was the Choc Nut which I didn‚Äôt like very much. I knew the traditional Chinese Hopia and polvoron. The new flavors of them I only tasted while I was already here in California. The Guyabano fruit is very good and healthy, it‚Äôs known here as sour sop fruit. Happy snackin, ube girl! Oh, BTW, I make my own ube-macapuno (shredded coconut) ice cream. ü••üòé"

manila is  a city and theres more municipalities to explore there is Makati pasay Taguig pasig Marikina quezon city etc....and each municipalities or city have there own  ohhhs and ahhhs to offer  and wondering how unique filipinos are.... from restaurant big or small ‚Ä¶.entertainment name it  ‚Ä¶. ask your local  filipino friend  about this
"We live part of of the year in the Philippines &amp; we love it. But u would never convince  me Manila is nice, never!"
Manila/Quezon City has a lot to offer...you just have to dig to find it...once known as &quot; The Pearl of the Orient&quot; and just like a pearl the city has many layers. Just give her a chance.
that was awesome dining at the roof top :-)) do you remember the name of the building and the location ?
you&#39;re right there is 14 municipalities in NCR Manila  one of them to name a few is quezon city pasig city Marikina antipolo and lot more to visit and its more fun to go one of this places and you will be love and enjoy it....google it

Nice vlog. Chicken Adobo ist really the Best. Like your cinematics views. Hope you can strive by and watch my road to philippines in a short vlog. Greetz from Germany
"Hi, im glad you found the eateries. Yes, they are many and cheaper and actually taste well. The problem is the presentation and sometimes several of the eateries look run down. But there are also several eateries that look just fine. On the hygiene aspect, if you use common sense, you can sense if the eatery is not clean. Trust your instincts. And the eateries cook many types of food and you will have the luxury of choosing the food you like.<br><br>The one you ate - puto - is actually made of rice. But lately there are also some puto which is made from flour. But generally puto is rice based. Glad you are able to appreciate Manila. When i was a little kid, Manila (meaning Metropolitan Manila) used to be a nice city but overpopulation and neglect in the past caused its looking &quot;run down&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot;. The past few years though, businesses and the government has tried to clean up and improve Metropolitan Manila. There is still a long way to go but at least new businesses and infrastructure are being built with improvements and sustainability in mind. Hope everything changes in the next decade - From a Filipino based in the US."

Pinakuratan like from former comments is Vinegar. Spiced vinegar. It&#39;s from the Visayan dialect word &quot;kurat&quot; meaning shocked or surprised and the prefix &#39;pina&#39; is added which means &#39;to do or have done something&#39;.  So pinakuratan means &quot;to shock/ to surprise&quot;. The condiment is so sour and so spicy you get surprised at the first taste.

Buy real coffee can be bought in local store not in groceries.
Eden cheese is a cheddar type of cheese and Pinakurat is an organic and homemade type of Vinegar that Filipino Specialty could only have :-)
"You can find pretty much any kind of food in the Philippines. It&#39;s just that you went to a provincial supermarket. Doesn&#39;t mean that western food is unavailable in the entire country or that the whole population only eat what you saw. These kinds of stores cater to the masses. And the masses need a very Filipino-centric and economical variety of goods, hence the unavailability of things like tomato ketchup, proper coffee, and cheeses in some rural areas. After all, not everyone in far-flung provinces can afford, will buy often enough, or have even come across things like brie :)"

@PierreTL...Available products in such a small city is limited. So choices are very limited as well which caters to such a small market. I think it&#39;s the only supermarket in Surigao?
@PierreTL...the Filipino who you said the Philippines has no &quot;regular&quot; catsup is pretty ignorant. He he. Of course we have &quot;regular&quot; tomato catsup. Just look around and read the label. We have two kinds of catsups here - the tomato and banana catsup. Or maybe no regular tomato catsup in Mindanao island? Did you try looking for it?

"&quot;There&#39;s no normal catsup here in the  Philippines.&quot; Then camera panned in on Del Monte catsup, that&#39;s tomato catsup right there.  Dude, what is a normal catsup in your country?"

"Suka (vinegar) PINAKURAT is a vinegar from the coconut and is one of Iligan City&#39;s Pride (Northern Mindanao). Pinakurat is a Visayan word that means &quot;to surprise/ shock&quot;.

"Tomato ketchup is still available in the Philippines but it&#39;s just that banana ketchup is cheaper, hence preferred by a lot of Filipinos."
We have real ketchup which is the Heinz brand depending what supermarket you went to or province. Soy sauce Kikoman is the best. We have real cheese but you have to go either a delicatessen.

When we visit the Philippines (we go off the beaten path) we usually make sandwiches that&#39;s easy to carry on hikes and stuff ourselves with fruits along the way.

Hey we have normal black coffee available in the supermarkets. Our family stays away from the 3-in-1 coffee mix due to its high sugar content. I&#39;m pretty sure there was black coffee available in the grocery you shopped in. Don&#39;t be shy to ask around. :)
How long you guys staying in the philippines? I hope you enjoy and safe as always...

Hi guys. Nice video. Good luck.
"Pinakurat,its spice vinegar"
EDEN - processed cheese. if you seen local dishes with cheese on it. that is normally the one they use. :)
"Can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s next on that island. There&#39;s a lot of regular tomato ketchup or catsup in local supermarkets by known brands such as Heinz and Del Monte, etc. There&#39;s actually a history on the origins of the banana ketchup. It was invented by an enterprising Filipino at the onset of WWII when there was an acute shortage of tomatoes and an oversupply of bananas."
"In provincial supermarket it&#39;s uncommon to see healthier choice, mainly because it&#39;s much expensive. High-end supermarkets can provide that in bigger cities."
"The manufacturers of those  products you showed(inside the grocery) on your video should pay you, for endorsing their products. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freeadvertisement"">#freeadvertisement</a>"
it&#39;s really cool. you&#39;re trying out the local stuff. ;)
"you could have made a very healthy popular hot dessert dish in mindanao called binignit. its made of gabe and 4 other different kinds of yams like purple yam, sweet potatoes, then you can add jackfruit, cooking banana, and sticky purple rice, then mixed and cooked with coconut milk, add some muscovado sugar or coconut nectar sugar. its delicious!"
"there&#39;s a lot of ingredients there in the market to make superfood dishes. ¬†you need to hire a filipino chef that knows how to cook that stuff. for instance moringa greens grows like weed in the Philippines. here in the west, the powder form is sold for $65 a pound! the coconut you bought needs to be squeezed in order to extract the coconut milk, the milk you can use for cooking, the remain coconut sediment&#39;s are tossed out"
"Too stressfull ;) . You are on vacation . Trina is more relaxing, just give her better speaking time !"
Can&#39;t wait for the next vlog.
So excited to see your next vlog. Enjoy.
pinakurat bottle is a fermented coconut nectar vinegar. it&#39;s an amazing vinegar used to dipped your barbecue and lechon lol

You have strong stomach and strong teeth Mikey. I might try tasting 1 cricket and 1 frog for one time only. But I&#39;m still afraid.
"I have eaten frogs legs, deep fried crickets and chocolate covered (don&#39;t hate me!) ants. I&#39;d like to try snake but I don&#39;t think I could manage a scorpion or a tarantula :) On the other hand after seeing you eat them..... maybe one day!"

"Manila can be compared to Gurgaon the cyber hub of North India cause it is also like the developed part is really developed, clean and beautiful but with it underdeveloped part also exists but far away from main part , so that better impression of the city can be made. But thing Manila has different and better is that even the less developed part is almost clean."
im watching ur whole journey to the Philippines! ON to the next one :)
Lovely video! Keep up the good work. If you have a moment you could go visit my account  üòäü§ô
Awesome Video + Tah is adorable! :-)
The trikes remind me of when I visited in 1994....
"New subscriber here. Enjoyed your vids so far üòäüôè Btw, catcalling is now a criminal offense in the Philippines so if ever someone catcalls you (which I hope doesn&#39;t happen) you can turn him in to the police."
South east asia country is paradise if politician not so corrupt. Hope sometimes in the something is good happen in this part of the world when standard a living improve and poverty is gone completely. South east asia people may look scary/shy (akward) at first but when you really understand them they are the most friendly people on this planet.
"If I ever win the lottery, lol, and go to the Philippines, I would go down the street in my wheelchair with a PILE of coins, and put coins all over the place where people could easily find them."
"You know, that 2 can fit on one bunk bed. Jimmy, build tah some walls so she can feel secure, lol."
Tah strongly reminds me of my thai ex girlfriend lol.
Wow you are in the Slums/Squatters Area!!! I&#39;ve nevered Exprerience that even though im Filipino ^^. But be careful ok we are not sure if they can be trusted.
"I wonder why there are people who unlike your video,  I think they just misclick the like thingüòÇ, btw how much will it cost when you want brand new hair cut in thailand or us? Something like this üòêüòÇ"
Btw Filipinos love to gawkü§£ü§£ü§£<br>The people make the placeüëçüèºWe Filipinos are warm people
Nice house hostel accommodations. Looks clean. Just don‚Äôt walk out at night?? Unless you‚Äôre in the core of Makati
My new favourite coupleüëåüèº tah‚Äôs so lovely. She looks like a kid at heart.
"some trycicle need to be full before leaving the terminal.... if special you just need to pay the rest of the seats so its ready to go.... but in the long run., you should pay additional.... Great youve visited Manila! I hope that you say only one tagalog word that you know in your video or ask what is the tagalog word for this? So that you can easily get in touch with the neighbors. hehe"
Fast food is something that  the Philippines picked up from western culture from Americans.
"Tah, is that natural the pupil in your eyes? It looks beautiful."
"enjoyed watching your vlogs, being on the roof is the bravest thing to do in manila! hands down for the two of you üôå"
"You two have the heart to go into places where tourists dare not go.  You carry your big back packs in crowded strange neighborhoods without dread.  Yet the locals seem to take care of you.  You two must have the qualities that natives seem to care and support.  I will follow your journey because now, I am one of your subscribers.  Take care cause we care."
"Here in the philippines, even though many poor people are in her, they still make fun for themselves."
"I love Tah, you are freaking hilarious &lt;3"
She is pretty girl nice vlog..
i love watching these couple&#39;s videos. no special effects or video enhancement. minimal editing. it just brings real life experience. well the lady is hot also. :)

"Divert Living what part in Manila where you found the Minute Burger.? Now I have interest to visit my home country.  Keep uploading ..... And pls stay safe especially if you are in Manila or big city, one thing I can say is please never put your wallet in the back pocket or else you will lost it without knowing it."
I feel for the girl and her adventures with cheap Charlie. lol looks like fun for him though.
"Oh dear you did not go there... take advice first before you go in, make it planning!"
Can never travel on an extremely tight budget like you guys (back packing).  Too hard.
"people in rural areas is much hospitable, accommodating, respectful &amp; honest too, compared to urban, I felt worry too, not all Filipinos are saints nor angels, be aware..."
"next time you can try Angels burger much cheaper buy 1 take one as well for only about P30 I think. if you will go around Manila, go to Intramuros Manila. nearby there are Manila Cathedral church, Fort Santiago, Luneta or Rizal Park, Museong Pambata has entrance maybe around P30 more or less. But when you are around the Luneta area be extra careful because sometimes we don&#39;t know if there are snatchers."
like your vlog
AWESOME!!
Awesome video guys! &lt;3
You guys are rock stars..... REALLY!!!!! thanks for sharing
"Hi, i like how you are enjoying your experience. Yes, i know it can be intimidating and overwhelming when you are in a new place with that sort of &quot;organized chaos&quot;. I am a Filipino, born and raised, but now based in the US . I am still overwhelmed when i experience something like that in a new place in the Philippines. Anyway, you have a very entertaining way of documenting your travel. Very interesting. Congratulations and welcome to the Philippines."
"atleast you didnt say manila or the philippines is dirty,smelly and other offended words that some backpakers did.Because Manila is huge. There are squatters but there are clean and fancy places too."
I&#39;d have about 10 minutes of burgers at that place.  I would also pack rolaids and imodium.  haha
don&#39;t use taxi&#39;s they are scammers... ubers or grabs are more honest
"Same problem, i need to have wall behind me to feel secured."
"I did not feel bored watching your vlogs. <br>Fresh and raw. Not the usual vlogs available in youtube, I guess it&#39;s because of yoir pertnership. I&#39;m an instant fan :)"
"Go to Angels Burger, with one bite you can taste all the bread"
hope you enjoyed  your stay in manila
I already like your vlog guys....
guys if you like chicken you NEED to go to Andoks it&#39;s the best chicken and it&#39;s really cheap! GOD i miss it! but yeah minute burger haha love the buy one get one free!
"Awesome guys, your Vlogs are just giving me more &amp; more inspiration, I bought a 1 way ticket to Thailand last week and will be travelling around S/E Asia for about 6months. definitely given me some amazing spots to check out and a big head up on the renting situation in Chiang Mai, although ill be chillin in beach area for the most part. anyway keep up the good work, killing it :D"
even catastrophe in the Philippines is something the people will see as an event to be happy with.  LOL
you&#39;re a nice couple. thank you for visiting our country and touring the poor areas. it&#39;s scary but you just need to smile and be the first one to approach and communicate.
You guys are fast becoming my favorite channel. How was the air quality? Last time I was there it was smog city. Looks cleaner now.
Totally agree with the people making the trip more than the destination :)
Of all the many nice parts of Metro Manila why the hell did you go to the slum area where the poorest &amp; inadequately educated Filipinos lived??? Your blog will just perpetuate the false narrative of the International Media that the Phil as mostly slums which is not!! Our economy is growing &amp; now has the fastest growth in the ASEAN &amp; there are building construction all over the place. By the way if you are looking for cheap place to stay there are numerous cheap hotels too that are far away from the slums/squatters.
"Cool stuff, guys! What do you two do for work?"
üëåüé•
airport sim cards are the best deals. looking forward to more philippine videos. go globe. You will love Dumaguete. I went to Uni there.  :-)
Wow that looks like fun and adventurous! I was surprised when you all climbed onto the roof haha. Definitely not a typical tourist experience :) have you had the chance to try the local Filipino food yet?
Dont stay squaters area.. you will not be safe there.
Are you near Legaspi Albay....Mayon Volcano is erupting....once in every 4 years though....
thanks for showing me the way.
Wow. So did those guys just invite u in there house? Pretty cool. We that the volcano where the smoke was from. Or just a fire?
Enjoy your time in the Philippines!! üáµüá≠

Yowww. Im from Philippines!! Thats lit

This is awesome how they let you in. They are really warm  and welcoming.
"Man! I have 30 days to kick it before I start teaching in Inner Mongolia and I almost chose to spend it in Manila... But instead, starting next Friday I&#39;ll be in Taipei. If I didn&#39;t have sssooo much luggage, I wouldn&#39;t have thought twice. I really miss PH! Great video! Welcome.... You will fall in love with this country.

Is it worth it
"I‚Äôm going to try these tomorrow, I‚Äôm not sure how this will goüòÇ I like spicy foods but I hear these are pretty bad spiceüò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨"
It ain&#39;t that bad quit being a fucken bitch
"I tried not these, I <br> as if nothing has happened I tried the MINI NUCLEAR but I died I miss the milk and it didn&#39;t help me."
Taste worst
The taste is bad
Gal gadot a.k.a wonderwoman is back!! Your very beautiful!! I missed you!!
i have a packet ive been trying to make but im scared it doesn‚Äôt even taste good because the first i did try it it wasn‚Äôt a good taste whatsoever
Okay I have this and I tasted the normal one and I was about to die and I‚Äôm scared to try this and I wanna see people‚Äôs reactions so I can feel ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and not be scared to try it TwT
Is it really that bad? I&#39;m planning on eating a lot because I like spicy food.
When i eat spicy i drink milk or milo
I have found an underrated account
Your teeth are so pointy cool!
girl...you&#39;re 2 years too late with those noodles ;-0
Don‚Äôt be emotional while eating. Ate you watching Titanic while eating?
"I&#39;ve tried these a few times now so I know how spicy they are, but the weird thing is that as I watched the video although I&#39;m not eating it, I started to get reaction as if I was eating it, like the top of my head started sweating!! üòÇ Never happened to me before so thanks for making me learn about myself...I think it&#39;s a psychological phenomenon discovered by a psycholigist named Pavlov using dogs to prove it."
`so pretty
Eating it would make you think of all the things you have been doing wirh your life.
dont cry
Haha I tried that and couldn&#39;t even finish the half of it. I ran to the fridge to get a milk and I finished 2litres of it. And took a shower immediately. üòÇ üòÇ
The first time i tried that the X5 i paired it with ice cream. Get well soon..
"If you want something thats spicy and the flavor is still there try lucky me pancit canton extra hot chili i really love but to be honest try all of the flavors original, calamansi, sweet and spicy, chili mansi, extra hot chili so you can get a lot of rating to do and try to find lucky me noodles it has a soup already ok try to find labuyo three flavors beef, chicken, pork please do it"

"I eat that a few times a month, pair it with bread or dont let it touch your lips. I love the taste<br>Love you vids simona"
That 2x Spicy Noodles may have possibly cleared your cold and sinus.  üòÇ
You are so cuuute! Getting addicted to your videos!! üòòüòòüòò
Hey just subscribed ur awesome
i think ice cream is the perfect partner of a spicy food
I love mi goreng &lt;3
"Next time (IF there is a next time lol) let it cool in the fridge first, then eat it cold LOL..it might help just a little bit!"
"just a little trick I do to tone down the spiciness is that eat it when it is cold or mix cheese with it or drink milk instead of water but what really got my attention is you&#39;re reading the instructions while cooking it, what I mostly do is just drain it then mix the sauce and eat it üòÇüòÇüòÇ I don&#39;t even read the instruction"
"I know this is not connected to your spicy noodle taste test but I&#39;d like to know what is your face foundation? Its on fleek, it looks perfect on you! üòä"
"during the stir fry step, add some all purpose cream. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. It balances the hotness. :)"
hahaha took a break from work to watch this. tried this and i died and you just rocked this with perfect cat eyes to boot üòçüòçüòçüòç
She looks like Gal Gadot at some angles. Haha
"Hurrah you&#39;ve finished it, hahahahaha."
U luk a like mis layne fable
Milk or yogurt is the best with extra spicy food.
"SNif snif snif snif, yup milk would have help !!  Always love your vlogs !"
Hooray! I did not finished that one the first time i ate it
"If you continue talking, the spiciness firing up"
"They said, the technique here is to eat this quick then after finishing there will after taste of like yoyr mouth is burning. üò≠üò≠. Just drool and spit it out your saliva. You can drink water or you may drink milk but still spicy."
I like your reaction the first time you taste it in wooden spoon. üòÇüòÇü§ó
"Love her, so adorable. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
You‚Äôre sniveling.
"This the most cutest and vulnerable i&#39;ve seen you. I know you are a tough girl bcoz you are Australian, but after seeing you like this I am beginning to believe it&#39;s really damn spicy. I&#39;m gonna try it tomorrow. Hopefully, no regrets. lol"
It does looks spicy. I would have quit on my first bite.

"Thanks for taking one for the team!üòÇ this was entertaining, needed the laugh."
&quot;i think i forgot how to read&quot; it&#39;s so spicy uou forget everything....

"I am so in love with her, such a real woman, its like I&#39;m in heaven and at peace..."
"Hahaha. Sorry, I was laughing so hard. Water can‚Äôt save you simona. Hahaha Next time try pairing it with a coffee flavored ice cream. Also, don‚Äôt let it touch your lips it will just worsen the pain. Hahaha<br>It sucks that the noodles taste so good but you have do undergo such torture whenever you eat it. Hahaha"
"You had me at &quot;Rekindle what we once had&quot;.üòú it&#39;s been a while and i definitely missed you and your vlogs, Simona! :)"
"I missed this! Epic reaction at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yib5VqVo8Q&amp;t=4m31s"">4:31</a>. üòÇ<br>My Christmas and New Years were alright. Not much fun though unlike when I was a kid. All there is were End of Year deadlines at the office. Your videos are one of the things that help me get thru especially after a hard days work."
love the flag in the background
"Welcome back <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Simona"">#Simona</a> &lt;3"
I have that also for maybe two months but I&#39;m scared to eat because of the 2x spicy
"i missed you simonaaaa and your vlogs and your taste tests ‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>I gave up after one bite of the original spicy noodle one, the one that is only 1x spicy with the black packet lol im so amazed you got to finish the whole bowl hooray for simona ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Great comeback Simona! üòÇ
"You&#39;re back!!! Where were you, Simona?! I am working since December, in a BPO centre. :)"
did someone tell you that you look like dua lipa?
youre baaaaack! nice to see you vlogging again!
&quot;I think I&#39;ve forgotten how to read&quot; üòÅüòÅüòÅ A taste test that became a challenge (somehow). üòÅ
Taste bud genocide.  You did not have to put yourself through this.  You really tortured yourself.  It is the first time I do not want any of your food. ohhh i will not finish watching this....
"Kudos to you, Simona! I died when I tried the regular fire noodle. 2x spicy probably feels like having all 9 circles of hell in your mouth. üî•"
Yessssss.your back
"Whenever I think about (let alone see) spicy food, my mouth just  waters. Now I&#39;m craving. Thanks! Hahaha. Good job for trying. Maybe the one with the black packaging will be more to your taste. It&#39;s milder. Try it!"
Hahaha yes I was waiting for this !  I had to drink water when we did it. I also didn‚Äôt know the right way to prepare it ahhaha
love your accent
we missed you üòçüòçüò≠
welcome back üòçüòçüòç
A very beautiful spicy noodles challenger
Its  says expired in the packaging though. But dont worry it just means its not as fresh as it can be
Yay finally been waiting for this üòçüòòüòù
"Believe or not it&#39;s very flavorful, besides being üî• AF!  You should definitely try it again so that you can actually taste it when your not sick that is!  The trick for me at least was eating it @ a not quick but steady pace till I was done.Even though it was hot as shiyet, I still enjoyed the taste.üò¨Aloha from the 808 State!"
I thumbs upped the video but I haven&#39;t watched it yet. I need to be eating something to totally immerse myself in your channel.
Is this a re-upload or you just ate an expired spicy noodle? It says 31.10.2016
miss you simonaaa!!
Finally!!! Welcome back to vlogworld... yey!
i havent tried that yet...  but i&#39;d love to....
You&#39;re baaaaack!!! Cheers!

"I tried this and I could only eat a mouthful. It was just too much, I can&#39;t believe you ate all of it. :&#39;D"
"I like ramen noodles too. I sometimes add cabbage, bean sprouts, or swiss chard...I keep it kind of simple, I have (however) seen people put a lot more extra..."
brave girl!!
We missed our Simona! üíû
Is there less spicy noodle?
its not food
"I can eat  Nuclear x3 of them, they are actually vegan, when i went for holiday in philippines  just few weeks ago, my nephews couldnt believe i actually ate x3 packets but i was sweating from the top of my head like somewhat open the tap, well done Simona"
"OMG Simona, you are the most well poised person I saw eating the spicy noodle! Even when you are crying you are still so poised! Love love love it!!"
try the X4 next time hahaha
I love Mi Goreng! Its my go-to snack plus vienna sauge on top! Yum!
My Christmas and new year is on a ship.. Working üòî
lmao
The most chillax spicy noodle video. The noodles taste delicious but i had to drink a pitcher of cold water and brown sugar in my mouth just to finish a few spoonfuls. And she ate the whole pack! Bravo.
Migoreng is the bomb!!!!
Video quality and sound quality of your video is good.
"I can handle spicy foods and love to test my limits but now I got ulcer so even though I wanna try it, I&#39;d rather not risk it... It&#39;s good to watch you trying it.. =) welcome back too~"
you look like Gal Gadot btw when you sede view
Always beautiful simona. Missed you!
When you&#39;re too excited that you got a notification from Simona that you didn&#39;t even read the video title. Missed youuu!!!
Ghaaaaad I miss you Simona üòçüòçüòçüòç
spice produces endorphins. you feel good and you get a bit of a high. and it can be addicting.
dairy products help with the spice.
"Hi Simona! Tried it already, never again üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
You look adorable while eating samyang simona üòç would you try next time the 4x? üòÖ‚úåüèª
I really miss ur vlog Simona hope everything ok with ur familyüòäüôè
"Such an &quot;emotional&quot; vlog... I thought the vlog would be short, youve managed to make it 17 minutes long. Being a &quot;taste test&quot;, you&#39;ve managed to finish it, well done! I cant handle really spicy food, my insides basically go haywire from the heat. That packet of Ramen has traveled abroad way more then I traveled in my entire life til now. Love your vlogs Simona. Didnt know we had that kinda of a relationship to &quot;rekindle&quot; something :P During the Christmas break I basically ate and slept alot, spending time with family in between :P"

New sub here but been watching your vlogs for a long time now. Its been awhile since your last one
"that thing is painful taking it in, and even more painful putting it out..lol"
Maybe eating it with cucumber would help.haha. Tried that but I only had a mouthful. Couldn&#39;t stand the spicyness. üòÇ
SIMONAAAA!! üíõüíõüíõ missed you
SIMONAAAA!! üíõüíõüíõ missed you

It&#39;s like torturing yourselfüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"If its hot enough, it should cure your cold"
Hi Simona! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"I messaged you in private, it was a very sad holiday season for my family, friends."
"Simona, please listen to Sign, Save Me and Rendezvous by DEAMN. Those songs are free youtube songs, you wouldn&#39;t have any problem about copyright üòâ"
"<b>*Simona looks at the flame*</b><br>&quot;Mesmerizing, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br>potential arsonist confirmed.<br>JUST KIDDING üòÇ"
"&quot;taste test&quot;<br>well played Simona, well played.<br>üòÇ"
&quot;It tastes like regrets.&quot; üòÜüòÜ I missed you Simona! Looking forward for more vlogs soon! üòò
Almost done watching all your videosüòÇ‚úå
"LolüòÇ i was laughing the whole time I&#39;m watching this video..&quot;i never cried like this in titanic&quot; -- you keep on looking at your side, as if you&#39;re asking for someone to save youüòÇ --love you Simona, welcome back‚ù§Ô∏è"
This noodle is best partnered with cheese. It somehow neutralize the extreme spiciness. Good for cold weather.
"I see   you are of the same school of thought that expiration dates (31 10 2016) are just guidelines............best line in the video, &quot;why would people do this to themselves?&quot; as she doggedly forges on..........."
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Welcome back!<br>I tried this before. Instant regret. hahaha can&#39;t stop tearing up and drinking water. LOL <br>It does taste savory if you get past the heat.
We missed you Simona! Great to see you again.
"Hun, it&#39;s true that water spreads the spice throughout your tongue... what you need next time is coconut water or milk for &quot;almost&quot; immediate relief. Otherwise, if you&#39;re really game have those spicy noodles with coke! üòùü§ò"
hi simona im glad to see you back. i have a technique on how u can finish it. even 3 packets or more.
Try the curry flavor from the same company. It&#39;s 2 pegs down in terms of spiciness and the added curry flavor is excellent!
milk not water
finally! celebrate my Christmas vacation in Noosa and Stradbroke ‚ù§Ô∏è
"As soon as you put the noodles in the bowl I started cooking pansit canton, hot chilli flavour üòù"
priceless reaction.. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I added tons of water and eggs to sort of mask the heat. Yea, I cheated but it made it more bearable üò∞"
Yes! Simona is back with a new vlog ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
You should prepare a glass of before you indulge hot spicy noodles from korea....just in case enjoy eating..
cool but Simona is your hair really black or did you just dye it?
Nooooo!!!! why did you do it
Finally! I&#39;ve been waiting for your new video updates. Yay!!!

Hi Simona!!! I&#39;m happy you&#39;re back!! sorry for laughing soo hard while you suffer from eating samyang hahahaha Your reactions are pricless  Thank you for doing this for us. &lt;3

You&#39;re so brave. You keep eating and you seem calm even though it is so spicy.
You keep blowing the noodles. üòÑüòÖ
You&#39;re back! :)
üòÇüòÇüòÇ You should‚Äôve tried this with a gallon of milk...maybe it would‚Äôve helped by minimizing the torture...maybe ü§•<br><br>...either that or become Korean/Thai/Indian
"Your vid is amazing as always. Welcome back. Anyway,How about a yogurt drink after eating the noodles? Does it work to subdue the chili‚Äôs hotness/spiciness?  Been meaning to do it as well but still waiting for friends to set a schedule. We‚Äôll be doing it thru vid conference coz we‚Äôre far apart. Like one friends is in Germany. We‚Äôre all frightened like you. Lol"
Rekindling atm. ü§™    feels good.   Good to know you‚Äôre back
This brings back painful memories. Less because of how spicy it was and more because I had to throw it away and I HATE throwing away food. :&#39;(

Love yoouu ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üî•
Do u live in the Philippines
I love your  videos üòª‚ù§
"My cousin told me that the secret to remove the spicy flavour is to drink hot water. I never tried it myself but he swears by it, because that&#39;s what he always does, hahahaha"
I still have the cheese samyang here but i&#39;m having a 2nd thought on eating it again lol
Welcome back Simona! Miss the vlogs!
Hahahaha i can&#39;t stop laughing seeing ur face when you eat it hahaha
Hi Simona the songs that you use are they free =)
We did a video of that challenge haha.. lasted for 16minutes just for a sachet! The two of us lol..
Awesome!! üôå‚úåüòÅ
Ice cream is the best for that
<b>Miss you Simona. I miss the egg too :)</b>
"Has anyone told you, you look like Gal Gadot?"

I heard that I has a strong chicken flavor...if only it isnt blow your face spicy
"Yey!  Your back, I miss your vlogsüòÄ"
.........it&#39;s actually very good with rice........tastes better and the spicy bite is more tolerable........ :)
I think (ehem).. That ahm.. (sniff sniff).. This is (drinks water).. Like I (ehem ehem).. I think I (drinks water).. Just like (sniff sniff).. This is (fans self with hands)... <br><br>üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"It&#39;s been a while, i really miss the vlogs. I haven&#39;t even tried samyang, that sauce looks terrifying; tho it will surely clear up your sinuses. I&#39;d rather eat 6 packets of indomie. lmao. I hope you&#39;re doing fine there. Drink lots of water."
&quot;It taste like a lot of regrets.&quot; üòÇ
I love samyang . I eat it every week üòÇ
wow samyang my favorite üòç
"Your eyes, reminds me so much of Winona Ryder&#39;s....so beautiful."
"loved the initial reaction when you first taste it and the genuine priceless reaction is a bomb!!! ( the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Regret"">#Regret</a> face &lt;3)"
"I like it before I watch, LoL"
I miss your vlogs simona! Hope you‚Äôre doing good! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre able to finish that because i can‚Äôt lol
I also like to eat that hahaha üòìüòìüòìüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
I missed you so much!!! I turned 22 last January 5th. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Simonaaaaaaa. I missed your videos üòÇ That noodle is definitely intense (and that&#39;s coming from someone with Bicolano blood running through my veins). But I managed to finish it (with a lot of regrets too haha üòÇ)
"We all spent holidays waiting for you.. T,T (cry cry)"
"At last, another video. Wooohooooooo!!!"
Simona why? Why do that to yourself? üòÇ My girlfriend would definitely watch this later when she gets home from work. She loves watching your vids too! üòÖ
"Welcome back poh simona, great video and great reaction love this vlog, üòÇüòÇ, love you poh..."
I feel you ate simona on the first bite!! Hahahaha I can&#39;t eat that spicy noodles again!!! It&#39;s delicious but it burning my tongue üòùüò≠
I think its because the one you ate is 2x spicier that&#39;s why its really hard to taste it. I&#39;ve tried the black one and it&#39;s way tastier compared to the red one.
"Double spicy, oh my! I guess it will burn you on the way in like almost crying, hahaüòØ....<br>Why you always do a taste test, are you aware of what food you really need to eat or just wanna show us what&#39;s the really the best food to eat?"
You somehow reminds me of Dua Lipa  lol
"good to see you again. :) i&#39;m not into spicy food but i like to see your video. btw, what are you doing in HK? I used to work and stayed there for 4 years. Now i am based in Singapore. :)"
"hi simona ! &lt;3 good to see you again. thumps up for you for eating the spicy noodles in relaxing way hehe. just chillin eating. hope to see your video blogs very soon.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23regrets"">#regrets</a><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23noregretsJUSTCHILLIN"">#noregretsJUSTCHILLIN</a>"
Good thing you only did a taste test and not the challenge. Can you do the Tide Pod taste test next? üòÜ (please don‚Äôt)
Had to hurry finishing dinner just to watch uninterrupted! Welcome back Simona! ‚ô•Ô∏è Hope you get rid of that nasty cold fast. üòâ
Eating while it&#39;s hot is just too much..<br>Eating something sweet will help but I can&#39;t finish 1 pack..<br>üò≠üò≠
Nice to see your vids again!
"This is the most emotional Simona vlog to date. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Regrets"">#Regrets</a>"
Yay finally &lt;3
"Welcome back! Considering you had a cold, this may have been a bad time to try this. Also, Sonny of the Best Ever Food Review Show can tell you more about the &quot;taste of regret&quot;. Check out his Palawan food series.:D"

Congrats for trying it!
&quot;it tastes like regrets&quot; :P
How to have glowing skin like yours.? You look even more beautiful. By the way miss your vlog
"unedited/raw  video is better than none at all, if it&#39;s too much for you to do too much editing, this kinds of videos ain&#39;t that too different anyways from your previous videos; remember real life comes first, vlogging is just a hobby. people follow you and subscribe not for the editing skills, but the content of your videos. same goes for movies, no matter how good the editing is, if it doesn&#39;t have a great story line, people won&#39;t watch it. anyways good to see you back. nearing 25k subscribers, so are we going to see you do the traditional bulgarian dance for hitting 25k??? lol"
ang lasa nyan ay parang yun dating lucky me spaghetti na sobrang anghang...lol
Got hiccups outta the first bite I had with that damn thing too! Haha! <br><br>Water doesn&#39;t help. Milk or sugar would though! =)
Just recently subscribed to your channel. Can&#39;t wait for more videos! üòç
Try the x4 version of it
Try the x4 version of it
I missed you so much. You should drink milk instead of water it will just worsen the spiciness of the noodles
"My nose sweats just thinking about its smell. I wont forget that taste. Also, why did you think it was a good idea to eat that while recovering from a cold? Haha"
We miss u simone... i hope more upload to come welcome back poüòäüëçüëå

Two vids in one day! As I work right thro the night I get this notification Simona spicy noodle taste test... break time &amp; winning üòÄ get better soon.!
Every time I cook this ramen I never finish it XD so well done!
ITS GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK‚ù§üíóüëå
Looking good Simona!
Simona ILYüòäüòÇüíüüíü
Yay!!!! You&#39;re back....
i noticed the expiry date... 31.10.2016??? or my eyes are just fooling me?
Where have you been girl? Hoping for new videos.
Yey another video!!!
"I technically don&#39;t celebrate both Christmas and new years but I was sleeping a lot this winter. Which I persoanlly prefer summer and tropical weather.<br><br>Good to know you&#39;ve finally tried that. I was sweating like crazy as if I was bathing myself with my own sweat when I first tried that. But I still have one more pack to eat it someday.<br><br>Tip, try drinking yakult and not water. Works better or milk or yogurt juice."
we missed you! great to see you again!
I‚Äôve tried it and I cried. I‚Äôm not good with spicy I tend to freak out and cry when eating one.
hello :)
hello :)
missed your vlogs
I heard dantdm&#39;s outro song.
"Your first bite, priceless. Full of regrets..lol lol lol..a very emotional vlog..üò•üòìüòµüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Me and my wife tried that before Christmas. That helped unclog our sinus in a few seconds haha :)
"Welcome back Simona! I tried this -- the burn I could withstand, but the moment I developed chest pain and a stomachache I had to stop. What a waste... but the 65-peso purchase didn&#39;t justify a trip to the hospital. The noodles were too saturated -- this is not for someone with a history of gastrointestinal inflammation. I did get the idea of cooking vegetables with that hot sauce -- I imagine it would add a fiery twist to chopsuey (a wok-full of chopsuey) -- next time maybe."
"Kamusta, Simona!üíú"
"since this is the first video I saw you cook (if instant noodles are considered as cooking), can you actually cook real food? I love your videos btw. keep it up! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Yehey after a long weekend you came back !
Go Simona! I hope you try the other flavors..

Whether we are not literally related by blood we call someone ate or kuya.. Which means elder sister and brother..we respect too much to the elders.. But we avoid giving po to those younger than us because we see it strange..
"that &quot;Unang Kagat Tinapay lahat&quot; which means &quot;First Bite is always bread&quot; HAHAHAHAHA that cracked me up big time, so funny. he is also so handsome &lt;3"

Yes Spaghette is sweet when now I live in the US at first  taste is sour  then  I get use of it. Then going back to the Philippines I found it sweet and I dont like  it anymore.
"Yes sinigang! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23proudtobeafilipino"">#proudtobeafilipino</a>!"
Kids: oh binaliktad na ( wala n tayong ulam ) it&#39;s kind of funny but it&#39;s kind of sad inside my heart
XD yeah.....basically our culture
haha unang kagat tinapay lahat haha
Thanks for the kind words
"The truth is that most Americans know nothing about Filipino culture. We might know about Japanese culture, or Chinese culture, but if you ask the average American about culture in the Philippines, most of us would scratch our heads and say &quot;Umm....I have no idea&quot;"
"its is funny, &quot;  binaligtad na&quot; hahahaha"
Gabi is taro root in English. Bicol region makes the ¬†best ¬†laing.

Pls..  Come and Visit Davao Philippines üòäüòÑüòâüòâüòÑüòä
Ubay is my home town..
1. The food is called &quot;Champorado&quot; Sticky rice with cocoa and normally eaten with milk and sugar. Normally eaten as breakfast or &quot;meryenda&quot; (snack)<br><br>2. Sorry in advance but just a correction. Peso = singular and Pesos = Plural (more than 1 peso)
champorado is a made up of glutinous rice or ordinary rice with sugar and local chocolate..
hi ! you guys  I watching your videos nice!!
try the Sinabligay Fiestival in San Juan Southern Leyte on June 24. a 2hr travel from sogod. &quot;WET AND WILD&quot; party.<br>:)

Go in Batanes .. it look like the place of Lord of the Rings Scenery..
nice man thx for sharing
Champorado the cereal of philippines
liked
Surigao is one of the poorest province of the Philippines because that place is infested with Communist insurgents (NPA) who extorts big money from any businessmen crazy enough to invest.
Very tough boat <br>Great vlog<br>Thank you for sharing
not exactly a luxurious trip.
next stopp. epic island cinematic shots
"We call it in the Philippines...&quot;No pain, no gain&quot;  After the day end you will have a good sleep... Hehehehe"
"Visit Tacloban City and try the Binagol, Roscas and Moron too."
"LOL better if Trina&#39;s speaking more so she can compared with her mother country Tha√Øland about many things, better having her point of view about fees for exemple or you should hv some others comments about arrogant French who do not know anything about Philippines life . Tarsiers fees lol beware to French sarcastic humour its not working on the Philippines ;)"
lovin this blog. raw and real. the travel is an adventure itself.
are you guys going to siargao?
"Wow! Bato is close to my mom&#39;s hometown (about an hour away). There are islands near in the area called &quot;Cuatro Islas&quot; (4 Islands). Anyway, if you go to Surigao, the nearby Siargao is now becoming the most popular destination in the Philippines. Apparently, it&#39;s magical! Have fun."
Action-packed. Loved the style of the video.
"You ate muron, sticky rice filled with chocolate. If you are in Bukidnon, man you try that food and it is very delicious. The water is free in turo turo or small scale food shop."
I know it&#39;s very stressful but I will enjoy this for the unique experience navigating thru the islands of the Philippines.<br><br>Did I hear Champorado (chocolate rice thing?) we normally put a little bit condensed milk for sweetness.
Love watching your videos guys. Specially when you are enter- acting with the locals and trying local delicacies.
"i am living in bohol hahaha....but im here in manila,,bohol has no traffic"

careful with were you where eating too and the water. if you will bring and convert the money from US to Philippines you would be like rich in the Phils because the conversion is big. but for a Filipino working and living in the Pbilippines P50-100 food is already expensive
